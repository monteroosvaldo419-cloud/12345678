"""Compare every card's stats, at every level, against the published tables.

The simulator computes a stat by scaling a level-1 base from the client files
through the rarity multiplier table. RoyaleAPI publishes the actual value at
every level - `hitpoints_per_level`, `damage_per_level` - which is an
independent source that can disagree, and disagreement is the only thing worth
having a second source for.

Index convention: an array's length tells you where it starts. Common cards
have nineteen entries, Rare seventeen, Epic fourteen, Legendary eleven,
Champion nine, matching each rarity's `RelativeLevel`. So the offset is
`19 - len(table)` and never needs the card's rarity, which matters because a
character row's rarity is not always the card row's.

Differences are bucketed rather than totalled, because they are not one
phenomenon:

  exact        the two agree
  within 1%    rounding path - the sim compounds rounded steps, the table is
               published rounded once. Not worth chasing.
  1-5%         worth a look
  over 5%      a real disagreement: usually the simulator scaling a card at
               the wrong rarity, or resolving it to the wrong character
               section entirely

This reports. It deliberately does not overwrite the simulator's values from
the published table: the shipped client files are sometimes ahead of RoyaleAPI
(the Goblin Hut rework is the standing example), so which source wins is a
judgement per card, not a blanket rule.
