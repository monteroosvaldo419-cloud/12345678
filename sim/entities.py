"""Entities on the battlefield: troops, buildings and towers.

One class covers all three. In Clash Royale a tower really is just a building
that cannot be deployed, and a building really is a troop with zero speed - the
targeting, attacking and dying code is identical for all of them, so splitting
them into a hierarchy would only mean writing the same logic three times and
letting the copies drift.

# The client's `Speed` is not millitiles per second - it is the game's own
# speed scale, where the named tiers come out as:
#     Slow 45, Medium 60, Fast 90, Very Fast 120
# and those correspond to roughly 0.56, 0.75, 1.13 and 1.5 tiles per second.
# That gives tiles/sec = Speed / 80, so millitiles/sec = Speed * 12.5.
#
# Taking `Speed` as millitiles/sec directly made every unit ten times too slow:
# a Hog Rider took over two minutes to cross the arena, no push ever arrived,
# and every simulated match ended 0-0 at full time.
# The data's Speed is **tiles per minute**: Slow 45, Medium 60, Fast 90, Very
# Fast 120. So a tile per second is 60, and the conversion to millitiles per
# second is x1000/60. This used to be x12.5, which moved every unit in the game
# at three quarters of its real speed - Slow came out at 0.56 tiles/sec instead
# of 0.75. Caught by playing the situation in a real match: a lone Ice Golem
# reaches an enemy princess tower and lands one hit, and the simulator had it
# dying a tile and a half short every time.
