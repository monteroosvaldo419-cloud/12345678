"""Tune the bot's config by playing variants against the current baseline.

This is what the simulator is *for*. Live, one setting takes five matches and
twenty minutes to evaluate, and the result is swamped by opponent variance -
which is why the block reviews have been changing numbers largely on argument.
Here a setting is 200 matches against the exact same opponent in half a minute,
so the answer is a win rate rather than a plausible story.

    python -m sim.sweep --key cycle_to_hog_elixir --values 3 4 5 6 --matches 120

Each variant plays the **current** config, both sides mirrored, so the only
difference in the match is the setting under test.

Read the caveat before acting on the output: this measures what wins *in the
simulator*, and the simulator's procedures are approximations. A setting that
wins here is a candidate for a live block, not a conclusion.
