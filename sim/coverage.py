"""How much of the card set does the simulator actually implement?

Three different questions, deliberately kept apart, because the flattering
answer and the honest one differ by a lot:

    parsed     the card's numbers load into a spec
    buildable  it can be put on the board and does something
    raw-key scan  no known top-level field is missing from this limited scan

A card can parse perfectly and still be wrong on the board. The Prince parsed
fine for months while the engine had no charge, so it was a slow Knight.
