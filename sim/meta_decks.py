"""A pool of opponent decks, and a coarse style for each.

The simulator's long-standing weakness is that its only real opponent is our
own policy. A mirror defends exactly as well as we attack and never punishes
passivity, which is why the simulator could not price tempo and why its
strongest strategic recommendation froze the bot live. Playing against several
different archetypes is the cheapest way out of that: a beatdown deck asks
different questions of a Hog cycle than another Hog cycle does.

The archetypes and the style rule are adapted from vegetableleaf/ClashAI, whose
scripted bots pilot real meta decks with deck-agnostic heuristics. Decks are
filtered against our own card data on load, so a deck naming a card the
simulator cannot build is dropped rather than half-played.
