    RoyaleAPI's public catalogue includes Party Rocket, whose current client
    spell graph is intentionally quarantined rather than faked. Excluding a
    card that would consume elixir and do nothing is safer than silently
    corrupting a supposedly random match. Mirror is included because Match
    owns its rule even though it has no ordinary SpellSpec.

    That catalogue is not the only gate any more, because it is stale. It
    carries 120 cards and none of the 2026 additions, so Ronin - present in
    roughly a tenth of real Path of Legends decks - was excluded along with
    Vines, Boss Bandit, Berserker, Goblin Demolisher, Suspicious Bush, Goblin
    Curse, Little Prince and Goblinstein. All nine are in the client data and
    all nine already worked; nothing but a third-party list was keeping them
    out, and an agent that never sees Ronin is not training against the ladder.

    So a card also qualifies if it has been observed in real ladder play, which
    is stronger evidence of being a public card than a snapshot is. The
    same-shaped safety still applies: it has to resolve into something Match
    can run, and `tests/test_cards_do_something.py` covers every card this
    returns, so a card that deploys and does nothing fails there.
