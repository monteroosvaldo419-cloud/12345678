"""Do the sim's card costs and rarities agree with the public snapshot?

This project's standing rule is that any number which changes behaviour gets
checked against something that can disagree with it.  `card_catalog_audit`
already proves every public card maps to a local row; that is an identity
check and says nothing about the values on the row.

Elixir cost and rarity are the two fields worth checking this way.  Cost drives
the whole economy, so one wrong number changes every affordability decision the
policy makes.  Rarity is worse than it looks: card stats are scaled from
level-1 bases *by rarity*, so a card filed under the wrong rarity has the wrong
hitpoints and damage at every level while still parsing cleanly - the exact
failure mode this codebase keeps hitting.

A disagreement is not automatically a bug. The client files ship ahead of
RoyaleAPI, and the rule is that the game's own files win. Divergences that have
been checked against the client row are recorded in `KNOWN_DIVERGENCES` with
what the client actually says, so a new one stands out instead of being lost
among the explained ones.
