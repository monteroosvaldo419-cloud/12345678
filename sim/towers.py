"""Tower stats, including the tower troops that replace a Princess Tower.

`sim/match.py` carried four hardcoded numbers - princess 3346/119, king
5735/137 - with an honest comment saying they were read off a live account
because the tower-level curve was not in the shipped files. It is now: the
published `cards_stats_building` tables give hitpoints at every level for both
towers, and the tower projectiles give damage at every level.

Checked against those tables, the hardcoded values match **no level at all**.
Princess Tower hitpoints run ... 2968, 3262, 3584 ... and 3346 sits between
levels 10 and 11; the King's 5735 sits between 5592 and 6144. Most likely the
account had a tower troop equipped, which is the other half of this module.

A tower troop replaces the Princess Tower and is not a reskin:

    Princess Tower   1400 hitpoints, hits every 800ms
    Dagger Duchess   1270 hitpoints, hits every 500ms
    Cannoneer        1200 hitpoints, hits every 2200ms, 1400ms load
    Royal Chef       1240 hitpoints, hits every 1000ms

A simulator that always models the Princess Tower is wrong about every match
played with one of the others - Dagger Duchess alone fires 60% faster.

Base stats come from the client files, which are the authority on mechanics.
Per-level hitpoints come from the published tables where they exist, because
the client does not ship the tower level curve.
