"""A headless Gym-style environment, for training a policy rather than tuning one.

Everything else in `sim/` answers "is setting X better than setting Y" by
playing whole matches with the hand-written policy. This exposes the same engine
one decision at a time, so a learned policy can act in it.

    env = ClashEnv(seed=0)
    obs, info = env.reset()
    while not done:
        action = pick(obs, info["action_mask"])
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

Design notes worth knowing before training anything on it.

**The opponent is the hand-written brain, not a random agent.** A random
opponent is not a test: this policy beat one 25-0, which says nothing about the
policy. The vendored ClashAI simulator fell into exactly that trap - random
actions won 12 of its 20 matches.

**Actions are masked, not penalised.** The legal set changes every step (elixir,
what is in hand, which half a card may be placed in), and 2,305 actions with
maybe 40 legal is far too sparse to learn from rejection alone. `info` carries a
boolean mask; illegal actions are treated as no-ops and flagged in `info`.

**The reward is shaped by tower damage, not only by the result.** A match is
~900 decisions and one terminal signal, which is a hard credit assignment
problem. Tower fractions are dense, monotone, and exactly what the game scores,
so the shaping is the objective rather than a proxy for it.

**Elixir is symmetric and honest.** The opponent's elixir is *not* in the
observation, because it is not observable in the real game either - the live
bot has to infer it (see `brain/economy.py`). Training on an oracle the deployed
agent will not have is how a simulator policy stops transferring.
