"""Let a trained policy drive the top seat, so both sides get better.

The reason this exists, stated plainly: **a fixed opponent cannot punish
passivity, so training against one says nothing about whether the win condition
is needed.**

That is not a theory. Training against `ScriptedOpponent` drifted to a policy
that took *zero* crowns in sixty evaluation matches, never played Hog Rider at
all, and still won a third of them - by chipping with Log and Ice Spirit and
taking the overtime tiebreak. Against a script that attacks on a timer and
defends with a heuristic, "never commit to anything" is a survivable plan. It
is not survivable against an opponent who notices you are not attacking and
walks a tank down the lane, because the tiebreak stops being reachable.

So the opponent has to learn too. `PolicyOpponent` wraps a checkpoint behind
the same `.reset()` / `.act(match)` interface `ScriptedOpponent` already uses,
and `sim.env.observe`/`legal_mask` hand it the board from the top seat mirrored
into the bottom frame - the same frame `grid_to_point` already flips placements
through. One network, either colour, no orientation to learn twice.

**A league, not a mirror.** Pure self-play against the newest checkpoint is a
known way to go in circles: two policies chase each other's current weakness
and forget how to beat anything else. `League` samples an opponent per episode
from past checkpoints plus the scripted meta decks, so the agent keeps having
to beat the decks it will actually meet as well as its own history.
