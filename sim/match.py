"""A whole battle: towers, decks, hands, elixir, the clock and the result.

Rules encoded here are the ones we verified by search earlier in the project
rather than recalled: both players start at 5 elixir and cap at 10, regeneration
is one per 2.8s, halving to 1.4s at 2:00 and about 0.9s at 4:00. A card returns
to hand only after four others have been played, which is why a cycle deck can
reach its win condition every rotation.
