"""Strict, evidence-based gate for RL training on the headless simulator.

Passing unit tests proves only the scenarios they cover.  A policy trained
against unimplemented client action graphs or uncalibrated contact physics can
learn exploits that cannot transfer to Clash Royale, so this command is
intentionally stricter than the ordinary test suite.
