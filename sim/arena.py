"""Arena geometry for the simulator, in the game's own units.

Units and why
-------------
Everything here is **integer millitiles and milliseconds**, because that is what
the client's own data files use: `Range = 800` is 0.8 tiles, `HitSpeed = 1600`
is 1.6 seconds. Converting to floats would mean converting twice - once on the
way in, once on the way out - and inviting exactly the drift that Clash Royale
itself avoids by running fixed-point arithmetic. Integers in, integers out.

Coordinates match `scripts/brain/arena.py` so a policy written against the live
bot runs unchanged in here:

    18 tiles wide, 32 tall, y increasing downward.
    y < 16 is the enemy half, y >= 16 is ours.
    Our princess towers sit at (4, 24) and (14, 24); theirs at (4, 7), (14, 7).

# belonged to the top half: measured from each tower to its own near lip, the
# bottom player walked 8.5 tiles and the top player 7.5. That is a free tile

# board does and matters most for exactly the bridge-spam decks it is meant to
