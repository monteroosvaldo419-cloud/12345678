"""A scripted opponent that plays a real deck with a plausible plan.

`SimpleOpponent` plays a random affordable card at a random spot, which is why
it loses about 99.7% of the time. That makes it useless as a measuring stick:
beating it says nothing. The alternative in use has been self-play, and a
mirror has the opposite problem - it defends exactly as well as we attack and
never punishes passivity, so nothing in the simulator prices tempo. That gap is
how a change that froze the bot live came recommended by the simulator.

This sits between the two. It is not strong and is not meant to be. It defends
what is actually coming, spends elixir at a rate its deck's style implies, and
reacts after a human-sized delay rather than on the tick the threat appears.
The design is taken from vegetableleaf/ClashAI's ScriptedBot; the code is our
own because the engines differ.
