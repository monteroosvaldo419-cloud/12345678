"""Sweep many settings unattended and write down what the numbers said.

One sweep answers one question in about a minute. Left running for a few hours
this works through the whole tunable surface, which is not something the live
loop could ever do: live, each setting costs five matches and twenty minutes
and the answer is swamped by opponent variance.

Results go to `tmp/live/campaign.md` as they arrive, so a run that is
interrupted still leaves everything it had learned.

    python -m sim.campaign --matches 160

Nothing here edits `config.json`. A campaign produces evidence; applying it is
a separate, deliberate step - partly because the simulator's procedures are
approximations, and partly because an automated tuner that edits the live bot
while it plays is how you end up unable to explain your own results.

# Ordered by how much is unknown about them. The scoring weights are the least
# explored part of the config: every one was set by hand from an argument.
# Defence first, and every range brackets the value currently in config.json so
# the first arm doubles as a control - a sweep whose control is not near 50% is
# measuring the harness, not the setting.
#
# Two reasons this list is aimed at defence rather than at the Hog. Measured over
# 34 live matches, the bot takes a tower in 62% of them and concedes one in 82%,
# and 53% of all matches end 1-1: offence is no longer the binding constraint.
# And every defensive number here was last swept *before* the spell-placement fix,
# so it was measured with Fireball and Log unable to reach anything on the enemy
# half - which is half of defending into a counter-push.
#
# Offence entries were dropped: the simulator over-rewards defence (its only
# opponents are an exact mirror and a bot it beats 99.7% of the time), so it is
# the wrong instrument for "should we attack more" and a fine one for "which
# defence trades better". See docs/RUN_JOURNAL.md.
