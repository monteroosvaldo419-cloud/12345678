"""Run many ClashEnv instances in parallel, because one is nowhere near enough.

A single environment steps at roughly 800 decisions a second, and a match is
~360 decisions, so one worker produces about two matches a second. PPO on a
problem this size wants millions of steps, which is days on one core and hours
across eight.

Workers are processes, not threads: every step runs the hand-written brain for
the opponent, which is pure Python and holds the GIL throughout.

    vec = VecClashEnv(num_envs=8)
    obs, masks = vec.reset()
    obs, masks, rewards, dones, infos = vec.step(actions)

Observations come back stacked, so `planes` is (N, C, H, W) and `scalars` is
(N, S) - the shapes a torch policy wants without further work. Environments
auto-reset on termination, and the observation returned on a `done` step is the
first observation of the *next* episode, with the final one preserved in
`infos[i]["final"]`. That is the SB3/Gymnasium convention; getting it wrong
silently bootstraps value estimates across an episode boundary.
