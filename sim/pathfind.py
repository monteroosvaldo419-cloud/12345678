"""Grid pathfinding for the arena.

The engine walked units straight at their target, detouring to a bridge when
the river was in the way. That is fine in an empty lane and wrong everywhere
else: a unit meeting a building simply pressed into it, and the steering patch
that followed only handled one obstacle directly ahead.

This is a breadth-first flow field over the 18x32 tile grid. Cost is one BFS
per distinct goal tile, cached, which is cheap enough to run inside a match:
576 tiles, and every unit heading for the same tower shares one field.

The river is impassable except on the two bridges, which falls out of the grid
rather than being special-cased in the movement code - so a unit that has to
cross finds a bridge because that is the only way through, not because it was
told to go there.
