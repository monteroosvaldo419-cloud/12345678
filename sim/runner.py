"""Play simulated matches, optionally driven by the live bot's own policy.

The point of the adapter is that `scripts/brain/policy.py` runs here unchanged,
so this measures the thing that actually plays rather than a reimplementation
of it. Two uses:

    python -m sim.runner --matches 20            benchmark and win rate
    python -m sim.runner --matches 1 --trace     watch one match unfold

The opponent is deliberately simple for now. Its only job is to be a punching
bag good enough to expose obvious policy failures; calibrating a realistic
opponent comes after the mechanics themselves are measured against the client.
