"""Present a simulated match in the exact shape the live policy expects.

`scripts/brain/policy.py` reads a BuildABot `State`: `state.cards[0..4]`,
`state.ready`, `state.numbers.*.number`, and `state.enemies` / `state.allies`
carrying `unit.name` and `position.tile_x/tile_y`. Reproducing that duck type
here means the policy that plays live runs unchanged against the simulator - no
second implementation to keep in sync, and anything learned in sim is directly
about the thing that actually plays.

The one conversion that matters: BuildABot reports tiles **bottom-up**, while
the simulator and the policy's own grid are top-down. `31 - y` appears exactly
once, here, for the same reason it appears exactly once in the live stack.
