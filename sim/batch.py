"""Run many simulated matches in parallel worker processes.

`sim.runner` is single-process: a match is CPU-bound and the game-data load is
paid once, so a sequential benchmark leaves every core but one idle. This
module spreads a batch over a process pool:

    python -m sim.batch --matches 200 --workers 8

Two Windows constraints shape the design. The spawn start method re-imports
everything in each child and pickles the work by qualified name, so the worker
function must live at module level (no lambdas or closures) and the entry
point must sit behind `if __name__ == "__main__":`. And because the game-data
load costs more than a match, it happens once per process in the pool
initializer; each child then reuses the resolved cards for every match it is
handed, kept in module globals because pool tasks themselves must stay plain
picklable data.
