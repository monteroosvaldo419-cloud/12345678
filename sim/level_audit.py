"""Which externally verified values are exact here, and which are extrapolated?

`combat_rules.json` is where this project records numbers it could not derive
from the shipped files - balance changes read off Supercell's own blog and
RoyaleAPI, each with a source URL and a verification date. Every one is stamped
with the level it was observed at, and every one was observed at level 11.

The loader used to apply such a value *only* at that exact level, so every
other level fell back to raw client scaling without a word. That was reachable
in ordinary play, not just by typing `--level`: Mirror resolves cards one level
up, and a mirrored Evolved Witch came out at 922 hitpoints against the 1451 she
is verified at - weaker for being played higher.

`gamedata.carry_verified` now carries a verified value along the client's own
scaling curve, holding its ratio to `scale_stat` constant. At the level it was
verified at it is returned exactly; elsewhere it moves the way every other stat
on that card moves. That is an extrapolation, not a measurement, and this
report is what says which is which.

    python -m sim.level_audit             level 11: everything exact
    python -m sim.level_audit --level 12  what Mirror resolves against
