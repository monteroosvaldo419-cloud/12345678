"""Predictions the simulator makes that a person can check in a real match.

The engine is tested against the game's own data files, which is necessary and
not sufficient. It was fully self-consistent and 25% wrong about movement speed
until someone placed one Ice Golem in a real game and looked. That single test
found five bugs.

So this prints a short list of situations with a concrete predicted number,
small enough to run through in a few matches. Where the sim and the game
disagree, the sim is wrong until proven otherwise.
