"""The exact clips to record, each paired with what the simulator predicts.

The remaining work on this simulator is measurement, not code, and the reason
it is tractable is that none of the missing physics is per-card.  Collision is
one rule reading each unit's collision radius and mass, both already parsed
from the shipped files; projectile steering is a `Homing` field.  So the matrix
measures a rule a handful of times, not a card against every other card.

Much of what used to be on this list is not here any more, because it was
never unmeasured - it was unfetched. The published datasets carry every
projectile's speed and its `homing` and `check_collisions` flags, every spell's
radius and duration, and both towers' hitpoints and damage at every level. A
shot that has left an attacker connects with what it was fired at, and
`check_collisions` is false, so there is no spatial miss to film. Projectile
timing, spell timing and tower damage all came off this list that way.

What is left is contact: how close two bodies stand when they meet, and how
close a troop gets to a building it walks past. No dataset publishes that.

Each probe below names one hypothesis, the tiles to deploy on, and the number
this engine currently produces.  Recording it turns the clip into an immediate
agreement or disagreement rather than a judgement call, and a disagreement is
worth more than an agreement.

    python -m sim.probe_plan              the shot list, with predictions
    python -m sim.probe_plan --checklist   just what to record, for the session

Nothing here promotes evidence.  Follow docs/LIVE_PROBE_PROTOCOL.md and add
accepted observations to data/validation/live_probes.json by hand.
