"""Compare the simulator against the real matches the bot has actually played.

We cannot replay a real match faithfully - only our own plays are logged, never
the opponent's - so this compares *aggregates* produced by the same policy in
both places: match length, cards played, and the card mix.

If the same policy behaves very differently in the two, the simulator differs
from the real game in ways that matter, and anything tuned in the simulator
will not transfer. That is the failure this project has to avoid, so the
numbers are printed side by side rather than summarised into a single score.
