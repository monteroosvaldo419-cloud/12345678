"""The battle tick: target, move, attack, resolve collisions, remove the dead.

Fidelity notes
--------------
The card *parameters* come straight from the client's own data files, so
hitpoints, damage, range, sight, speed, mass and collision radius are exact.
What is not in those files - and therefore what this module approximates - is
the **procedure**: how targets are chosen and re-chosen, how a unit paths to a
bridge, how overlapping units push each other apart, and in what order all of
that happens within a tick.

Those approximations are stated explicitly at each site rather than buried, so
that when they are measured properly against the real game the corrections have
an obvious home. Getting them wrong is the main risk in the whole project: a
policy trained here will happily exploit any of them.

Order within a tick is fixed and matters:
    1. tick down deploy timers
    2. acquire or re-acquire targets
    3. attack (windup, then damage on the hit cycle)
    4. move whatever did not attack
    5. resolve collisions
    6. remove the dead
Attacking before moving means a unit already in range fires this tick instead
of stepping first, which is what stops units jittering in and out of range.

# --- documented approximations -------------------------------------------
# Real retarget rules depend on per-unit flags whose exact semantics are not
# documented in the data files. This is the placeholder: re-evaluate a target
# only when the current one dies or leaves sight, plus a periodic sweep.
RETARGET_INTERVAL_MS = 500

# What a body block costs, as a percentage of normal speed while pressing past
# an enemy troop that cannot be attacked back.
#
# It used to cost nothing. The steering below deflects a unit sideways at full
# speed, so a Hog rounded a wall of Skeletons and carried on - measured at 0.6
# seconds lost, against a live match where the same block cost it FIVE tower
# hits (7 hits unblocked, 2 blocked; tmp/live/studio/clip_20260828_153533.mp4,
# tower HP read frame by frame at 317 per hit).
#
# That single number is most of why every policy trained here spams: if cheap
# bodies cannot stop a push, defending cheaply does not work, and throwing
# everything at every threat is the correct response to this world. It is not
# the correct response to Clash Royale.
#
# Calibrated with scripts/probe_body_block.py against that recording, whose
# unblocked control the simulator already reproduced exactly.
BODY_BLOCK_STEP_PCT = 100

# Two attempts to express a body block as a speed penalty have failed, and the
# way they failed says what the real mechanism is not. Recorded so neither is
# tried a third time.
#
# 1. Cap the blocked unit to its blocker's speed (BODY_BLOCK_HOLDS_CONTACT).
#    Right for a moving blocker, fatal for a stationary one: a Musketeer stops
#    to shoot, so its speed while blocking is zero, and the cap becomes a wall.
#    Reintroduced the Hog deadlock outright.
#
# 2. Scale the step by a fixed percentage. Swept for the recorded 2-hit result
#    and 35% produced it - by coincidence. The same 35% gives 2, 5, 0 and 4
#    hits across four blocker placements, where 0 means the Hog never arrives.
#    It also failed three body-block tests, including a Giant no longer able to
#    round a body.
#
# The measurement is not in doubt: a recorded block cost a Hog 5 tower hits
# (7 unblocked, 2 blocked) where this engine costs 1 (7 and 4). But the effect
# is not proportional to speed, which is why both attempts miss. A block is
# contact and the damage delivered during it - traced, blockers land 34 of
# their 224 dps because they spend the fight chasing rather than hitting. The
# fix belongs in how contact converts to damage, not in how fast the blocked
# unit walks.

# Hold a blocked unit to the speed of whatever is blocking it.
#
# OFF by default: this changes how every ground push in the game resolves, and
# it is not enabling until it has been measured against the recording rather
# than assumed. Flip it and run scripts/probe_body_block.py - the target is 7
# tower hits unblocked and 2 blocked, which is what a real match produced.
BODY_BLOCK_HOLDS_CONTACT = False

# Let a unit steer around an ALLY that has stopped.
#
# Reported from the viewer: a Hog placed behind its own Ice Golem stays glued
# to it the whole way down the lane, advancing only when the Golem does, where
# the real game has the Hog round it once the Golem connects. The complaint is
# correct and the engine does behave that way.
#
# OFF because three attempts to express it have all frozen units. Treating
# every ally as an obstacle deadlocks pairs of equals; restricting it to
# slower allies still froze a wizard; restricting it to stopped allies froze
# the same wizard. tests/test_stuck_units.py catches each one, and a frozen
# unit is a worse defect than a welded push - it is the failure class that has
# cost this project the most.
#
# The remaining suspicion is that steering around a stationary ally can walk a
# unit into a position where its own deflection re-triggers every tick. That
# wants the collision rewrite rather than a fourth guard on this generator.
ALLY_STEERING = False
# Pushback is mass-weighted and resolved iteratively in the real game; one pass
# is enough to keep units from stacking without being a physics simulation.
# Two passes at full strength. One pass at 60% only decays an overlap rather
# than resolving it, so bodies stayed sunk into one another by up to a fifth of
# a tile indefinitely. The requirement is simply that nothing overlaps and
# nothing walks through anything, which needs the correction to converge.

        connecting, not walking. Everything else `is_valid_target` checks -
        side, alive, untargetable - still applies, because none of those give
        a unit somewhere to go either.

        A placed building only counts as a destination if the unit can see it,

        Cannon in the far lane is not where a unit sent down this one is
        going. Crown towers are always eligible - they are the destination of
        last resort, and in a real match every unit has one to walk at.

        The gate is therefore conditional on there being an alternative. With
        no tower standing and nothing in sight, the far building is not
        competing with the lane, it *is* the only place to go, and gating it
        unconditionally left units standing where they were deployed. That
        cannot happen in a match - a king tower is always there until the game
        ends - but it happens constantly in tests that build a bare arena, and
