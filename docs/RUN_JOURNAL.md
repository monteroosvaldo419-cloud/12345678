## 2026-08-16 â€” Claude (Opus 5), initial takeover

**Stopped** the previous run: `overnight_supervisor.ps1`, two `mumu_katacr.py` bot
processes, and two `capture_daemon.py` capture daemons. No other agent CLI was running.

**Diagnosis** from `tmp/live/blocks/block_040..042.log` (428 plays, 12 matches):

| symptom | measurement | cause |
|---|---|---|
| barely plays Hog | hog 11.9% of plays | Hog gated behind "no enemy in our half", which is almost never true |
| does nothing for long stretches | 723 `SHIM veto` vs 428 plays | the shim layer vetoed rather than decided |
| random Fireball / Log | spells aimed by the learned checkpoint | value checked in *units*, not elixir |
| loses defence | Cannon played against air | no air/ground distinction anywhere in the code |
| result | 0 wins visible, towers lost in 11 of 12 | â€” |

**Replaced** the learned-checkpoint-plus-shim design with `scripts/brain/`, a candidate
generator plus scorer. The KataCR checkpoint is out of the hot path: over sixty logged
matches it scored 11 crowns for and 90 against, and it cost about a second per decision
on CPU.

Mechanics were re-verified by web search rather than recalled â€” Cannon at the 4-3 tile
(four from the river, three from the centre), Ice Golem kited one tile past the centre
into the opposite lane, Musketeer deep and never at the bridge, Skeletons to surround,
cycle a cheap card at the back at 9 elixir.

**First live match on the new brain**: won 2-0, 42 plays. But Hog share was 7% and 39
of 42 plays were defensive, so three follow-up fixes went in:

1. `defend_min_threat` â€” a lone Skeleton over the bridge is no longer "a push".
2. A **hard** elixir budget per push (`defend_elixir_ratio`, `defend_max_cards_per_push`).
   A soft score penalty was not enough; the threat bonus outbid it every tick.
3. `hog_counterpush` â€” once a push is *contained* (our units are on it), the Hog goes
   in the other lane instead of waiting for the field to be empty.

Also fixed: match records were reading tower HP off the end-of-game screen, which
covers the arena, so every match scored identically. They now use the last in-battle
reading.

**Infrastructure** for the unattended run:

- `supervisor.py` â€” blocks of 5 matches, prunes disk each block, reviews asynchronously
  so the emulator keeps playing during a review.
- `review.py` â€” dispatches the block review across agent CLIs with a quota-aware
  roster; a review that breaks the tests is reverted (brain and tests only, never a
  whole-tree reset).
- `captain.py` + Scheduled Task `HastyCR-Captain` (30 min) â€” promotes the next agent if
  the lead goes quiet for two hours. Order: Claude, Kimi, Gemini.
- `watchdog.ps1` + Scheduled Task `HastyCR-Watchdog` (5 min) â€” restarts the supervisor
  if it dies or its heartbeat goes stale.

**Next agent should look at**: Hog share (still the weakest number), and whether
`defend_fallback_*` plays have actually stopped.

---

## 2026-08-16 18:10 â€” Claude, blocks 1-7

An `IDLE` diagnostic was added to `cr_bot.py` (any dead stretch mid-battle logs elixir,
hand, threat and committed elixir). It immediately caught three deadlocks, all of my own
making, all now fixed and covered by tests:

1. **The defence budget could disable defending.** Sized on what the opponent's cards
   *cost*, a five-unit swarm push (threat 35, almost free) exhausted the cap and the bot
   stood still for 17 seconds holding a Cannon. Budget now also scales with threat
   score, the card cap grows with threat, and `emergency_depth` bypasses budgeting
   entirely for anything within 21 rows of our tower.
2. **It never cycled toward the Hog.** Caught at 4 elixir, no Hog in hand, no threat,
   doing nothing. `cycle_to_hog` now spends cheap cards at the back specifically to
   reach Hog again. This is the deck's core mechanic and it was simply missing.
3. **Holding elixir for the Hog blocked the defensive fallback.** A 24-threat push
   walked in while the bot banked five elixir for a Hog it could not afford either.
   Only *optional* spending is now deferred for the Hog; defence never is.

**Infrastructure failure worth remembering:** the review loop did not turn for four
consecutive blocks. The opencode/Kimi reviewer hung for ~50 minutes retrying
`clashroyale.fandom.com`, which returns **HTTP 403** to this machine, and the supervisor
politely skipped every subsequent block behind it. Three fixes: the review prompt now
carries an explicit web budget and names that domain as forbidden; `dispatch` has a
whole-run deadline instead of only a per-agent one; and the supervisor kills a review
(with its whole process tree) that outlives 2.5x its timeout instead of skipping for
ever. **Gemini now leads the review roster** â€” it returned a clean 97-row unit table
first try â€” with Claude last so the strongest quota is kept for takeover.

**Measured over the last 6 matches**: 1W 2L 3D, 5 crowns for / 6 against, 41.7 cards per
match, Hog share 9.6% (up from 7.4%), `cycle_to_hog` firing 20 times. The dominant
decision tag is still `defend_fallback_ice_spirit` (34 of 250 plays) â€” that is the next
thing to attack: it means the proper answer was not in hand, which is a *cycling*
problem, not a defence problem.

---

## 2026-08-16 18:50 â€” Claude, blocks 8-13. **A regression, and the correction**

The automated loop is turning by itself now: blocks 8-12 all played, reviewed by
`gemini_pro`, applied with tests passing, no agent benched, disk steady near 89 GB.

**But results got worse, and it was my fault.** Ten-match sample:

|                   | before the defence budget | after |
|---|---|---|
| record            | 2W 0L 1D | 1W 6L 3D |
| crowns for/against| 5 / 1    | 3 / 10   |
| cards per match   | 41.7     | 30.4     |
| mean match length | 176s     | 154s     |

Fewer cards played *and* more crowns conceded *and* shorter matches is one coherent
story: the hard per-push elixir budget I added was starving the defence. It was my own
invention, not something 2.6 doctrine asks for at that tightness.

The correction keeps the *principle* â€” defend for less than they spent â€” but expresses
it as a preference rather than a prohibition:

1. Budget relaxed: `defend_elixir_ratio` 1.1 -> 1.6, `defend_min_budget` 4 -> 6,
   `defend_threat_to_elixir` 0.35 -> 0.5, cards per push 3 -> 4.
2. New `contained_defence_penalty` (-22): once our units are *on* the push, more
   defence is scored down instead of being forbidden. This is the honest version of
   what the hard cap was trying to do.
3. The elixir reserve no longer applies to a **contained** push, and
   `hog_min_elixir_contained` is 4. Counter-pushing at low elixir off a defence that is
   already holding is the deck's core play, not a risk to be prevented.
4. `kite_min_threat` 4 -> 6: Ice Golem was kiting cheap ground units 4.5 times a match
   and was never in hand to lead the Hog, which is its more valuable job.

**Lesson for whoever reads this next:** a constraint that looks principled in the code
can still lose games. Change one lever at a time and read `crowns for/against` and
`cards per match` together â€” either alone would have hidden this.

---

## 2026-08-16 19:25 â€” Claude, blocks 13-16. Cycle-block, and guarding findings

**The reviewer undid the correction.** Within two blocks of the entry above, a review
set `defend_elixir_ratio` to 0.9 â€” tighter than the value that caused the regression â€”
plus `defend_min_budget` 3 and `cycle_to_hog_elixir` 2. That is not the reviewer being
careless; it has no memory of the run and the code gave it no reason not to.

So findings are now **enforced, not documented**: `scripts/brain/bounds.json` holds a
safe range and a one-line reason for every setting a finding depends on, and
`scripts/config_guard.py` clamps `config.json` back into range after every review. It
caught all three of the above on its first run. Reviewers may tune freely inside the
envelope; to move a bound they have to argue for it in their notes with block evidence.

**The real reason Hog share was stuck near 10%: the bot was cycle-blocked.** Over 42
matches the four cheap cards were 78% of plays while Musketeer, Fireball and Log were
each under 5%. In a cycle deck you cannot reach a card without playing the ones in front
of it, so holding the expensive three meant the rotation never came back to Hog. `_cycle`
now has a third branch: at 8+ elixir with no Hog and no cheap card in hand, play the
cheapest card available purely to advance the rotation â€” and a cycled *spell* goes at
the weaker enemy tower for chip rather than being dropped at our own back line.

First live check after the change: two Hogs inside the first 60 seconds, one of them a
`hog_counter_right` off a contained defence â€” the intended play.

**Next agent should look at**: `defend_fallback_*` is still the most common tag. With
the cycle unblocked, check whether it falls on its own before touching it.

---

## 2026-08-16 20:00 â€” Claude, blocks 17-19. **The card detector was lying**

The block reports had been showing Ice Spirit at **26.5% of all plays**. That number is
arithmetically impossible: in an eight-card deck four other cards must be played before
any card returns, so no card can exceed 20%. An impossible measurement is not a strategy
finding, it is a broken instrument â€” so I stopped tuning and checked perception.

`scripts/check_hand.py` captures a live frame, prints the detected hand, and saves the
hand strip so the two can be compared. Two captures, seconds apart, with **no card
played and elixir unchanged**:

```
hand=['the_log','musketeer','ice_spirit','cannon']    <- verified against the pixels
hand=['the_log','musketeer','hog_rider','cannon']     <- slot 3 flipped
hand=['the_log','musketeer','blank','cannon']         <- slot 3 vanished
...
hand=['fireball','skeletons','ice_golem','blank']     <- slot 4 vanished
hand=['fireball','skeletons','ice_golem','cannon']    <- and came back
```

Animated card art appears to be the cause. This mattered more than any strategy setting:
the runner taps a **slot** because the policy believed a particular card was in it, so a
misread slot means playing the wrong card at a position chosen for a different one â€” and
it silently corrupted the only feedback the review loop had.

`brain/hand.py` applies the same idea the unit tracker already used: a slot is believed
only once it agrees with itself across several frames, and its votes are cleared when
that slot is played. Per-match `hand_flips` now goes into every match record, and the
block report states the 20% ceiling explicitly so no future reviewer treats an
impossible card share as a strategy signal again.

**Next agent should look at**: `hand_flips` per match. If it is high, perception is
still the bottleneck and no amount of `config.json` tuning will help.

---

## 2026-08-16 20:40 â€” Claude, blocks 20-22. Which cards were actually confused

First, a correction to the entry above: **`hand_flips` over-counts.** It increments on
every change including legitimate ones, and with ~25 plays a match a count of 50-96 is
mostly real card changes, not misreads. Do not read it as an error rate.

The evidence that does hold up is the card mix. Measured shares:

    ice_spirit 24.6%   ice_golem 17.4%   skeletons 19.2%   ->  61.2%

61.2% is almost exactly 3/5, which is the correct total for three cards in an eight-card
rotation. So the **trio's total was right and only the split between them was wrong** â€”
that is a signature of confusion *within* a group, not of random misreading. Confirmed
offline by scoring every pair of deck cards against each other: the closest pairs are
`ice_golem`/`ice_spirit` (0.577) and `ice_spirit`/`skeletons` (0.348) â€” the cheap blue
cards, exactly the trio above.

Upstream reduces each card to an **8x8 greyscale hash** and then assigns all five slots
jointly with `linear_sum_assignment`, so one bad crop steals a card and forces wrong
answers in the other slots too. `brain/cards.py` adds a second opinion: full-resolution
crops, 32x32 (16x the information), **normalised cross-correlation** â€” which is
invariant to the linear dim-and-desaturate that "you cannot afford this" applies, the
effect upstream approximates with a hardcoded scale and intercept â€” scored **per slot**,
and returning `None` when the top two are within 0.04 rather than guessing. Its answer
is used only when it is confident; otherwise upstream stands and the temporal tracker
decides. Tests confirm all eight cards identify their own art and still do after the
greyed-out transform.

Colour was tried and rejected on evidence: RGB made `ice_golem` vs `ice_spirit` *worse*
(0.679 vs 0.577), because the shared structure dominates the concatenated channels.

**How to tell if this worked:** no card may exceed **20%** of plays. If `ice_spirit` is
still above that in the next blocks, perception is still wrong and tuning `config.json`
is wasted effort.

## 2026-08-16 21:30 â€” Owner review: "it just puts hog alone". Pushes, economy, LLM

The owner's diagnosis was exactly right and worth recording verbatim: *"it places
something as soon as it gets enough elixir instead of deciding what to place according
to what is coming"*. That was literally the architecture - every tick scored the
affordable cards and played the best one. There was no notion of waiting, and no model
of the opponent at all.

**1. Pushes are now plans, not cards** (`brain/push.py`). A push is an ordered sequence
committed to as a unit: `golem_hog` puts Ice Golem at the bridge and the Hog behind it
one second later (the guide timing), `punish` sends the Hog alone, `counterpush` follows
a held defence, `probe` is a lone Hog only when we are rich enough that losing it does
not lose the tower. A plan is only *started* if we can pay for all of it, which is what
stops the naked Hog. Verified live: `push_golem_hog_tank_left` then
`push_golem_hog_win_condition_left` two seconds behind it.

**2. The opponent has an elixir model** (`brain/economy.py`). Start 5, cap 10, regen
2.8s / 1.4s / 0.9s with double at 2:00 and triple at **4:00** (the config had 3:00 -
wrong, now fixed). Enemy cards are charged when first deployed.

Two bugs found by watching it live rather than by reasoning:
- charging every *re-acquired* track billed units already fighting in our half over and
  over, pinning the estimate at 0.0 for whole matches;
- even after fixing that, the integrated estimate drifts low, so "their bar is empty"
  was true nearly always and every moment read as a punish window - the lone Hog again.
  The punish trigger is now **observed recent spend** (>= 5 elixir in the last 5s),
  which does not accumulate error.

**3. A local LLM advises on intent** (`brain/advisor.py`). `qwen3:4b` on the RTX 4070 Ti
SUPER via Ollama, schema-constrained so the reply is always valid JSON. It owns
*judgement* - intent, card, lane, coarse zone - and the deterministic layer keeps the
exact tiles, because the 4-3 Cannon and the kite spot are web-verified geometry a 4B
model can only degrade. Two hard rules: it runs on a **worker thread** so a ~0.8s call
never slows a ~2Hz loop, and it can only **bias the score of candidates the rule engine
already produced and judged legal** - it cannot invent a play, place a troop in the
enemy half, or spend elixir we do not have. If Ollama is down the bot is unaffected.
Live: 13 consultations in a match, 0 failures.

**4. Card knowledge** (`brain/card_stats.json`, 97 cards, Gemini + web-verified):
hitpoints, dps, hit speed, range, sight range, speed, targets, splash, deploy time,
mass, role, counters. Only the stats for units currently on screen go into the prompt,
which keeps it small. Worth noting: I doubted its "Fireball does not kill Musketeer or
Mega Minion at equal level" entry and checked - **the data was right and I was wrong.**

**5. Arena sprite references** (`scripts/sprite_harvest.py`, `--harvest-sprites`).
Harvested from real matches using the detector's own bounding boxes, a few examples per
class, ~1 MB for 14 classes. Card portraits were rejected for this: a Musketeer portrait
looks nothing like her 30-pixel arena sprite, and arena crops are what a YOLO model will
actually need. First attempt derived crops from unit *tiles* and produced pictures of
the floor - sprites are drawn above their ground position.

## 2026-08-16 22:20 â€” Learning from measured outcomes

Owner asked for "fake reinforcement learning" - the model noticing an interaction lost
and updating a database of what actually counters what. Built as two layers, because
they do different jobs.

**The layer that changes behaviour: a contextual bandit** (`brain/experience.py`).
Every play is snapshotted with the situation it answered, then judged after 7 seconds:

    reward = enemy elixir killed + 14 x tower damage dealt
           - elixir spent        - 18 x tower damage taken

Mean reward per (situation, card) goes into `learned.json` and is added to that
candidate's score - damped by sample count and clamped to +/-14, so a few lucky
episodes cannot overrule a rule that came from the actual 2.6 guides. No gradients, no
network: decisions are discrete, feedback is delayed by seconds, and it has to run at
2Hz next to the emulator. A bandit is the right size of tool.

**The layer that is legible: matchups and lessons.** `matchups.json` records, per (our
card, the unit it engaged), how often that unit died and how the trade went.
`scripts/lessons.py` turns that into short imperative lessons in `brain/lessons.md`,
which are injected into the advisor's prompt - so the LLM plays by what the bot has
measured, not only by what the guides say.

**Two modelling bugs, both caught by reading the first output rather than trusting it:**

1. Crediting a play against *every* unit on the field produced
   `hog_rider vs ice_golem: 100% kill rate`. The Hog never fought it; an Ice Golem was
   simply on screen. Now only units within 7 tiles of where the card landed are
   credited, and only for card families that actually engage.
2. At a two-sample threshold a single coincidence became a confident lesson
   (`ice_spirit vs balloon: +19.33`). Raised to four.

**The generator model also mattered.** `qwen3:4b` wrote the statistic back at me -
"Use ice_spirit against knight for +2.56 mean" - which is not advice. Lessons run once
per block, not in the decision loop, so latency is irrelevant there and quality is not:
they now go to Gemini with a local fallback. The difference:

    before: Use ice_spirit against knight for +2.56 mean
    after:  Counter an enemy Knight using an Ice Golem instead of Skeletons.
            Defend medium pushes with Skeletons rather than a Cannon.

It also returned four lessons instead of ten when the evidence only supported four,
which is the behaviour the prompt asks for and the small model ignored.

Footprint after ~10 matches: 87 KB of learning data, 5.5 MB of sprites across 52 unit
classes. The supervisor regenerates lessons every block automatically.

**Then the reward function itself turned out to be wrong, twice, and both bugs pointed
the same way: they punished the win condition.**

The first run of `show_learning.py` reported:

    hog|none|contained    hog_rider(10): -3.8

Ten samples saying the deck's only source of damage is a mistake. That is not a strategy
finding, it is a broken instrument - the same lesson as the impossible card share
earlier - so I stopped and audited the measurement instead of the policy.

1. **The window closed before the Hog arrived.** A defence resolves in seconds; a Hog is
   deployed at the bridge, walks about five, *then* starts hitting. Judged at seven
   seconds it was still walking, so it banked the cost and none of the payoff. Attacks
   now resolve at 13 seconds, defences stay at 7.
2. **Tower HP was aggregated with `min()`.** Once a tower reached 0.0 it could not go
   lower, so every point of damage after the first tower fell was invisible - and every
   Hog after that scored as a clean four-elixir loss. In one of the matches feeding that
   `-3.8` we had *taken* a tower. Now summed across both towers, so damage to either one
   registers.

Both were caught the same way: a number that disagreed with something known to be true,
followed by auditing the measurement rather than believing it. Worth keeping as the
habit - the reward function is the one component where a silent error does not crash
anything, it just teaches the bot to play worse for hours.

---

**Correction to an earlier entry:** I set the Hog-share target at "15-25%", which is
partly impossible. Four other cards must be played before any card returns, so **20% is
a hard arithmetic ceiling**; realistic is 12-18%. That wrong target had been steering
reviewers toward changes that could never have paid off. Now fixed in the block report
and the review prompt. Hog share after these changes: 16%, 12%, 22% in the last three
matches, up from 7-10%.

---

## 2026-08-17 - lead handover (claude_session quiet 251 min)

**Loop state.** Alive. Supervisor heartbeat 7.7 min old at 00:46, block 24, status
`playing`. One supervisor, one captain, one `cr_bot.py`. Note for whoever checks the
process list next: each venv `Scripts\python.exe` shows up as a *pair* of processes
(the venv stub re-execs the base Python312 interpreter with the same argv). That looks
exactly like a duplicated loop and is not one. Do not kill either half.

There is a 4-hour gap in `supervisor.log` between block 22 finishing at 20:48 and
`SUPERVISOR start block=23` at 00:38, but matches were still being written at
00:08-00:15. The log and the match dir disagree about that window; worth a look if it
recurs.

**What I saw.** Block 22 scored 4 crowns for / 6 against (0W 1L 4D). The last three
matches were worse: 1-1 with our surviving tower at 10%, 1-1 at 21%, and an 0-2. Our
left tower died in all three.

The failure is not that the bot does not defend. It is that it *only* defends, at one
to three elixir, forever. From the live log of match #2:

```
PLAY #16 ice_golem  (14,21) defend_fallback_ice_golem  elixir=2  spent=13
PLAY #21 ice_golem  (10,22) defend_fallback_ice_golem  elixir=2  spent=20
PLAY #32 ice_golem  (10,24) defend_fallback_ice_golem  elixir=2  spent=35
PLAY #38 ice_golem   (9,25) defend_fallback_ice_golem  elixir=2  spent=46
```

`spent=` is `committed_elixir`, the per-push defensive budget. It reached **56** in one
match. The budget is supposed to cap at `max(5, threat_elixir*1.2, threat_score*0.5)`.

**Root cause.** `policy.py:1043` skips the budget check entirely when `_emergency(obs)`
is true, and `_emergency` was "any threat at y >= 21". Our tower is at y=24 and the
river at y=16, so 21 is the middle of our own half - true on essentially every tick of
every push. The budget, `defend_max_cards_per_push`, and `defend_elixir_ratio` were all
dead code in practice. The bot therefore sat at 1-3 elixir permanently, which is also
why Hog share fell to 8-12% (below the 12% floor): the `unanswered_penalty` on offence
needs `elixir - cost >= 3`, i.e. 7 elixir for a Hog, and the bot never got there. Hog
plays only ever happened in the rare `threat=0/0` gaps, tagged `push_punish_*`.

Roughly 45% of all plays in these matches were `defend_fallback_*` - the scoreboard's
"elixir spent on nothing" line, at its worst yet.

**Changes (2, both `config.json`).**

1. `emergency_depth` 21 -> 23 (bounds allow 19-24). Restores the defensive budget's
   authority. The bypass now fires only for units within a tile of the tower row, which
   is what "past the point of budgeting" was meant to mean. This also gates
   `defend_fallback_*`, which only emits when `not out and _emergency(...)`.
2. `weights.hog_push` 36.0 -> 44.0, matching `hog_punish`. It was the lowest-weighted
   Hog family and below every single defend weight.

Web-checked the doctrine before touching either: 2.6 is "defend with minimal elixir,
bank the rest, punish when they over-commit", and over-defending is the named beginner
mistake. Both changes push toward that.

**One change attempted and reverted.** I raised `defend_min_threat` 5.0 -> 6.5 to stop a
single mid-threat unit marking the whole match `serious`. It fails
`test_spells_are_not_thrown_at_nothing`: a Knight at (9,18) scores 5.22, so at 6.5 it
stops being serious and `cycle_chip_the_log_left` throws The Log at the enemy tower with
a Knight walking in. **That test pins `defend_min_threat` at <= ~5.2.** Raising it at all
requires first gating the `cycle_chip_*` rule on "no ground threat in our half", which is
a `policy.py` change and needed more than my remaining budget. Left alone.

`pytest tests\test_brain.py -q`: 34 passed.

**For the next agent.**

- Judge change 1 on `spent=` in `cr_bot.log`, not on crowns alone. If it is still
  climbing past ~15 in a match, the budget is being bypassed some other way.
- If defence now feels thin, do **not** reach for `defend_elixir_ratio` or
  `defend_threat_to_elixir` first - `bounds.json` records that tightening the former
  cost 10 crowns to 3. Raise `emergency_depth` back toward 21 instead.
- The `cycle_chip_*` gate above is the real blocker on ever raising `defend_min_threat`.
  That is a clean, well-scoped one-change job for someone with the budget.
- `fallback_min_threat: 12.0` exists in `config.json` and is read by nothing. It is a
  dead knob; either wire it into the `defend_fallback` gate or delete it, but do not
  tune it and expect an effect.
- `enemy_elixir` in the logs reads 0.0-1.0 almost continuously. Either the opponent
  genuinely never banks or `economy.py` is under-counting; if the latter, every
  "they cannot answer" judgement in the Hog rules is running on a broken input.

## 2026-08-17 (overnight) â€” Claude. **The simulator**

Built while the live bot kept playing and learning in parallel. `sim/` is a full
Clash Royale battle simulator driven by the client's own extracted parameters.

    sim/arena.py      geometry, integer millitiles and milliseconds
    sim/entities.py   troops, buildings and towers (one class - a tower is a
                      building that cannot be deployed, a building is a troop
                      with zero speed)
    sim/engine.py     the tick: target, attack, move, separate, reap
    sim/match.py      elixir, decks, hands, the clock, crowns, the tiebreak
    sim/spells.py     Fireball and Log from their projectile definitions
    sim/adapter.py    presents a match in the shape the LIVE policy expects
    sim/runner.py     play matches, self-play or against a simple opponent
    sim/batch.py      multiprocess batch runs (written by Kimi via opencode)
    sim/gamedata.py   loads the extracted client data (written by Gemini)

**The whole design turns on `adapter.py`:** `scripts/brain/policy.py` runs inside the
simulator unchanged. There is no second policy to keep in sync, and anything measured
here is about the thing that actually plays.

Everything is **integer millitiles and milliseconds**, because that is what the client's
data uses (`Range = 800` is 0.8 tiles, `HitSpeed = 1600` is 1.6s). Converting to floats
would mean converting twice and inviting the drift Clash Royale itself avoids with
fixed-point arithmetic.

### Four bugs, each caught by a measurement disagreeing with arithmetic

1. **Speed was read as millitiles/sec.** It is not: the client's `Speed` is its own
   scale where 45/60/90/120 are Slow/Medium/Fast/Very Fast, i.e. tiles/sec = Speed / 80.
   Taken literally, every unit moved **ten times too slowly**; a Hog took two minutes to
   cross and every match ended 0-0 at full time.
2. **Ranged units had zero damage.** A ranged unit carries no `Damage` of its own - it
   fires a projectile, and the damage sits in the `[PROJECTILE.X]` section its
   `Projectile` field names. So Cannon and Musketeer did nothing at all. A Cannon that
   cannot kill a Hog is not a subtle fidelity issue.
3. **The top player read the board upside-down.** Placements were mirrored for side -1
   but its *view* was not, so it defended the wrong half. Self-play read 20-0 to the
   bottom, which looked like a strong policy and was a blind opponent.
4. **The bottom player always decided first**, winning every timing tie: 115-72 in
   self-play, three sigma from even. Decision order now alternates each tick; it is
   102-87 now, which is noise.

### What it is worth

    self-play (identical policies)   102W 87L 11D over 200 matches
    throughput                       8.9 matches/s on 8 workers  (~770k/day)
    single process                   ~2.4 matches/s

Symmetry is the headline check and it is pinned in `tests/test_sim_symmetry.py`: two
identical policies must win about half each, and any large skew means the board favours
a side. That test is what found bug 3.

`tests/test_sim_fidelity.py` checks the simulation against arithmetic derived from the
client's numbers - Hog crossing time, an unopposed Hog taking most of a tower, a Cannon
killing a Hog, a Musketeer outranging a melee unit. 137 tests pass overall.

### Honest limits - read before trusting it

- **Parameters are exact; procedures are guesses.** Pathfinding, retarget tie-breaking,
  collision resolution order and the within-tick ordering are approximations, marked as
  such at each site in `engine.py`. A trained policy will find and exploit whichever one
  is most wrong.
- **The simple opponent is not a test.** The policy beat it 25-0. That is the same trap
  the vendored ClashAI simulator fell into (random play won 12 of 20 there). Use
  `--opponent brain` for anything you intend to believe.
- **Spells are under-used**: Fireball is 0% of plays in sim. Either the policy's value
  conditions are too strict or the sim gives it too few clustered targets. Unresolved.
- **Nothing has been validated against real logged matches yet.** That is the next
  piece of work, and until it is done the sim is plausible rather than trustworthy.

### Validation against real matches, and what it found

`python -m sim.validate` compares aggregates from the *same policy* in both worlds.
A real match cannot be replayed - only our own plays are logged, never the
opponent's - so aggregates are the honest comparison available.

**The card mix agrees closely**, which is the encouraging part:

    card         live %   sim %   delta
    cannon         15.3    15.6    +0.3
    skeletons      19.2    19.1    -0.1
    musketeer       7.6     7.1    -0.5
    the_log         5.8     5.1    -0.7
    fireball        1.3     0.3    -1.0
    ice_golem      17.6    15.7    -1.9
    ice_spirit     21.3    17.6    -3.7
    hog_rider      12.0    19.5    +7.5

Six of eight within two points, from a policy that was never tuned for the
simulator. That is a real signal the mechanics are close.

**Two divergences, one of which was a genuine bug:**

1. **Jumpers were walking to bridges.** Hog Rider, Battle Ram and Royal Hogs carry
   `JumpEnabled` in the client data and **leap the river**. Routing them to a bridge
   added a long detour that fed them to the defence. Fixed; `sim/engine.py` now lets
   jumpers cross where they stand.
2. **Simulated matches still run long** - 256s in self-play, 228s against a weak
   opponent, against 160s live - and produce fewer crowns (0.2/match self-play).
   Offence in the simulator is weaker than reality and this is **unresolved**.

   Caveat on that comparison, since it is easy to over-read: the live figure is the
   *bot's own clock*, started when it first recognises the in-game screen, not at the
   real kickoff. Real matches are at least 180s. So some of the gap is measurement,
   not physics - but not all of it, because the crown rate is low too.

Fixing the Cannon-vs-Hog test taught the same lesson twice over: the original assertion
("a Cannon kills a Hog") only passed because the Hog was taking a long detour and eating
fire the whole way. With the detour removed, the arithmetic is plain - Hog 322 damage
into 835 hitpoints beats Cannon 208 into 1718 - and the real interaction is that the
Cannon *pulls* the Hog while the towers kill it. A test can pass for the wrong reason
and hide a bug rather than catch one.

### First result from sweeping

`python -m sim.sweep --key <setting> --values ...` plays variants against a frozen
snapshot of the current config, alternating sides. 80 matches per value takes about a
minute, against twenty minutes and five matches live.

    defend_min_threat    4  -> 53.2%   (7-1 on crowns)
                       6.5  -> 40.5%
                         9  ->  9.1%   (7W 70L, 0-15 on crowns)

A review had previously set this to 6.5. It is now 4.0 and bounded to [3.0, 6.0] with
the evidence recorded in `bounds.json`. This is the first setting in the project decided
by measurement rather than argument.

**A methodological trap worth remembering:** the first sweep had every variant losing,
including one set to the value the baseline already had, which scored 33% where it
should have been a coin flip. The cause was that the live review loop rewrites
`config.json` between blocks, so the experiment was racing a file that changed
underneath it. `sweep.py` now freezes a snapshot first. Always run the null case - a
variant identical to the baseline - and check it comes out near 50%.

**Follow-up: the "weak offence" was not weak offence.** Instrumenting one match and
recording where our Hogs died:

    death positions (grid y):  9.7  10.7  10.2  9.8  9.7  10.2  9.8  9.8 ...
    enemy towers at the end:   0.35 left, 0.31 right,  from 13 Hogs

The tower stands at y=7 and a Hog attacks from about y=9.3 (tower radius 1.5 plus Hog
range 0.8), so they were reaching attack range and landing hits - together taking both
towers to roughly a third. Nothing is broken.

What the simulator is really showing is that **a 2.6 mirror is a defensive matchup**:
both sides hold a Cannon and cheap answers, so towers grind down without falling and
matches go to overtime. Live, the bot faces varied decks that do finish towers, which
is why live matches end with 0.00 readings and simulated mirrors end near 0.30.

So the sim/live duration gap has two causes and neither is a physics bug: the live clock
starts late (it begins when the bot recognises the in-game screen), and the simulated
opponent is a mirror rather than the ladder. Both are worth remembering before reading
any simulated result as if it were a ladder result.

### A mistake of mine, and the process problem behind it

I changed `defend_min_threat` from 5.0 to 4.0 on a sweep that read 53.2% - about 1.5
sigma - and where **the tool printed "within noise - not enough evidence to change
anything"**. I applied it anyway. A later campaign on a different seed set put 4.0 at
-7.1 against a 5.0 baseline, i.e. the effect flips sign with the seed set, which is what
"within noise" means. The block-26 review reverted it to 5.0 and was right to.

The `defend_elixir_ratio` change stands on much better evidence and is not in the same
category: 200 matches per value, +2.8 sigma, effect saturating at 2.0, and it agrees
with an independent live regression measured hours earlier. Two independent lines of
evidence, not one marginal one.

**The rule I should have followed, and that anyone tuning here should follow:** act on a
sweep only when it clears roughly two sigma *and* something else points the same way.
Otherwise leave the value alone. The whole point of building the sweep tool was to stop
settling these by argument; overriding its verdict because the direction felt right is
the same failure in a new costume.

**Process problem worth knowing:** the live review loop rewrites `config.json` between
blocks, so a campaign freezes whatever was there when it started - which may not be what
you last set. That is how a -7.1 delta appeared against a baseline I believed was 4.0
when it had already been reverted to 5.0. `campaign.py` now records the frozen baseline
value next to every result. If you want a clean campaign, stop the supervisor first.

### The campaign, and why the 2-sigma rule earned its keep immediately

45 configurations, 140 matches each, reported as a delta against a control on the same
seeds. Full table in `tmp/live/campaign.md`. At this sample size two sigma is about
8.4 points.

**Nothing cleared the bar.** The most tempting result was `defend_cannon = 45.0` at
**+7.5 with a crown differential of 22-7** against the baseline's 5-4. Just under the
threshold, but the crown margin made it look like a real find.

Rerun on a different seed set at 300 matches:

    defend_cannon  45.0 -> 34.1%   (101W 195L, crowns  87-158)
                   58.0 -> 55.1%   (163W 133L, crowns  91-74 )

So 45.0 is **catastrophically worse**, not better. The +7.5 was noise, and the crown
differential - which felt like corroboration - was noise too. Small-sample crown numbers
are *noisier* than win rates, not a check on them. Applying that finding would have made
the bot substantially worse, an hour after I made exactly that mistake with
`defend_min_threat`.

**Results that do hold up, all confirming current values rather than changing them:**

    cycle_to_hog_elixir  3.0  -> -15.8    do not lower
    probe_min_elixir     8/10 -> -16/-14  do not raise; 6 is right
    predict_seconds      2.6  -> -14.7    do not raise
    kite_min_threat      4    ->  -9.7    confirms the earlier 4 -> 6 change

That last one is worth noting: `kite_min_threat` was raised from 4 to 6 earlier from live
reasoning about the Ice Golem being spent on cheap units instead of leading the Hog. The
simulator independently says going back to 4 costs about ten points. Two methods, same
answer.

**Several knobs turned out to be dead.** `defend_max_cards_per_push` (3, 4 and 6),
`hog_counterpush` (40, 52, 64), `defend_kite` (40, 55, 70) and the `cycle_to_hog` weight
all produced **byte-identical results** across every value tested - the matches did not
diverge at all. Those settings are either never binding or are dominated by other terms
in the score. Tuning them is wasted effort until something makes them matter, and any
review that claims to have improved one of them is reporting noise.

### Where the bot actually stands, stated plainly

    all-time   136 matches   14W 76L 46D   crowns  71-156   hog 11.5%
    last 40                   4W 26L 10D   crowns  20-50    hog 11.4%
    last 15                   2W 10L  3D   crowns   8-20    hog 11.5%

**It loses about two thirds of its matches and there is no improvement trend.** Every
individual fix in this journal is real and several are well evidenced, but they have not
added up to a winning bot. Anyone reading the earlier entries should read this one too.

Two things that stop the numbers being misread:

1. **Self-play in the simulator says nothing about absolute strength.** ~50% there means
   the policy draws with *itself*. Use it for A/B comparisons only.
2. **Trophies are stuck at 5501** after 136 matches at 14W-76L. Normally that record
   would sink the account hundreds of trophies until matchmaking found easier opponents
   and the win rate drifted to 50%. It has not moved, so the bot keeps meeting ~5500
   opposition it loses to. Tower levels are matched (3346 both sides, level 12), so this
   is not a levels mismatch - the opponents are simply better.

The honest reading: the remaining gap is not another config value. Candidates, roughly in
order of how much they could be worth:

- **Reaction latency.** The loop runs about 2 Hz; a human reacts in a few hundred
  milliseconds. Every defensive placement is up to half a second late.
- **Perception.** Card misreads were measurably reduced but not eliminated, and unit
  detection quality has never been quantified at all.
- **Strategy depth.** The policy has no notion of opponent deck, card cycle tracking, or
  what the opponent is holding.

Tuning `config.json` further is very unlikely to close a two-thirds loss rate.

### The biggest single improvement of the night: reaction time

Having written that the remaining gap was probably latency rather than another config
value, I measured it instead of guessing. `scripts/profile_loop.py` splits the loop:

    adb screen capture     377.5ms    90.5% of the loop
    perception (detector)   39.4ms     9.5%
    policy decision          0.0ms     0.0%
    total                  416.9ms  -> 2.4 decisions/sec

So reaction time was **entirely a capture problem**, and the policy - the part this
project has spent all its effort on - costs nothing at all.

`screencap` is uncompressed, so its cost is transfer, not encoding. A 1080x1920 frame is
**8.3MB** and takes ~406ms; process spawn and round-trip account for only 16ms of that.
Halving the display makes the frame 2.07MB and the capture 117ms.

Everything downstream was calibrated for 1080x1920 - `tower_hp` even bails out below
1900px, which is why it returned 0.0 for every tower at half size. Rather than
recalibrate the tower reader, the popup guard, the card crops and every tap constant,
the resolution is normalised **in one place**: `mumu_overnight_bot.capture` upscales
frames to 1080x1920, and `tap` scales coordinates back to the real device. Nothing else
in the codebase knows the device changed, and if the emulator reverts to 1080x1920 the
same code handles it with no change (the upscale becomes a no-op and taps scale 1:1).

    before   416.9ms   2.4 decisions/sec
    after    185.9ms   5.4 decisions/sec

Verified end to end rather than assumed: the card classifier and the upstream detector
now agree exactly on the hand, `tower_hp` reads real fractions again, and a screenshot
confirms the Cannon landing on the 4-3 tile for `grid=(6,20)` - so taps are scaling
correctly. 150 tests pass.

`run.ps1` re-applies `wm size 540x960` on every launch, since the setting reverts when
the emulator restarts. `adb shell wm size reset` undoes it.

**What this does not do:** it does not make the policy smarter. It removes up to a
quarter of a second of lateness from every defensive placement, which is worth having
when the bot is losing two thirds of its matches - but the next measurement, not this
entry, decides whether it mattered.

## 2026-08-17 03:20 - Claude (captain handover). **The enemy elixir estimate was fiction**

Took over as lead; the previous lead had been quiet 144 minutes. Loop was healthy on
arrival: heartbeat 12 minutes old, block 34 playing, 125.3GB free. The two supervisor
and two cr_bot processes in the task list are a launcher shim and its child, not a
duplicated loop - worth knowing before someone "fixes" it.

**The measurement that matters: the last two blocks are the first non-negative ones
since block 2.**

    block 30    0W 4L 1D    crowns 1-8     hog  9.0%
    block 31    1W 2L 2D    crowns 3-5     hog 13.4%
    block 33    1W 1L 3D    crowns 2-2     hog 13.0%    <- first latency-fixed block
    block 34    0W 0L 5D    crowns 3-3     hog 14.8%    <- + gemini's budget relaxation

Against an all-time baseline of 71-156 on crowns and 11.5% hog, that is two level blocks
in a row, hog share inside the target band for the first time, and `defend_fallback`
falling from 26% of all plays to 19.9%. The latency fix and the budget relaxation both
appear to have worked. Neither is proven by two blocks, but nothing here should be
reverted on the next bad block alone.

**What I changed (two, not three - see the last section).**

**1. `economy.py` was billing the opponent for elixir they never spent.** The previous
lead flagged `enemy_elixir` reading 0.0-1.0 continuously as a suspicion. It is real, and
the live log confirms it on every play of block 34: `enemy_elixir=0.2`, `=0.0`, `=0.5`,
match after match.

(Read the "for the next agent" note below before treating this as settled: the arithmetic
proving the over-billing is solid, but the live effect is not yet measured.)

The cause is an interaction between two modules. `observe_spawns` charges any track with
`hits == 1` and dedupes on unit *name* for `SPAWN_DEDUPE_SECONDS = 6.0`. But
`tracker.STALE_SECONDS` is 2.5, so a unit the detector loses for three seconds in a fight
is deleted and comes back as a fresh track - and any unit living longer than six seconds
outlives the dedupe window and is billed again, repeatedly, for as long as it survives.

Replaying a realistic 180s match through both paths:

    OLD   billed 126 elixir   mean estimate 2.2   under 1 elixir in 5/18 samples
    NEW   billed  56 elixir   mean estimate 6.7   under 1 elixir in 0/18 samples

The opponent can physically generate only **90.7** elixir in 180s (5 start + 120s at
2.8s + 60s at 1.4s). Billing 126 is not a drifting estimate, it is impossible, which is
what makes this a bug rather than a tuning question.

The fix: `observe_spawns` now takes `visible=`, every enemy name on the field this frame,
and refreshes the dedupe timer for all of them after charging. A unit that never left the
arena can no longer be re-billed however long the fight runs. This deliberately
*under*-counts (a second Musketeer played while the first lives is free), which is the
direction the module already documents as the safe one.

**Why this is not cosmetic.** I checked every consumer before touching it: `is_low` and
`is_committed` are dead code, nothing reads `obs.enemy_elixir` in scoring, and the Hog
punish gate runs on `recent_spend`, which was never affected. So the previous lead's
worry - "every 'they cannot answer' judgement in the Hog rules is running on a broken
input" - was **not** correct, and I want that recorded so nobody re-investigates it.

The one real consumer is `advisor.py:229`, which puts the number straight into the local
LLM's prompt as "Estimated enemy elixir: 0.2". Block 34's m003 shows `advice_used: 31` of
39 plays. The advisor was being told the opponent was broke on essentially every tick and
was steering the majority of the bot's plays on that basis.

**The thing to watch, stated in advance so it is not read as a regression:** the advisor
will now often see a *full* enemy bar where it used to see an empty one, and it may
correctly become less aggressive. **Hog share may fall.** If it falls to ~13% while
crowns hold or improve, that is the fix working, not breaking. Judge this on crowns
first. If hog share falls below 12% *and* crowns get worse, revert the `visible=` wiring
in `policy.py:204` - it is a three-line change.

Also added `tests/test_push_and_economy.py::test_a_unit_that_never_left_the_field_is_billed_once_however_long_it_lives`,
which pins the exact 2.5s-stale / 6.0s-dedupe interaction. `economy.py` had no test
coverage at all before this despite feeding the advisor.

**2. Deleted the dead `fallback_min_threat` knob** from `config.json`. Two previous
agents flagged it as read by nothing; it is now gone rather than flagged a third time.
Behaviourally a no-op. The `defend_fallback` gate remains `_emergency(obs) or (air and
obs.serious)` - if someone wants that gate tunable, it needs wiring, not a value.

`pytest tests\` : **151 passed** (was 151 before; +1 new test, and the suite already
covered the rest).

**Timing.** Code changes do not hot-reload - `cr_bot` picks them up when the supervisor
restarts it - so both edits landed at 03:20-03:21 and block 35 started 03:21:54 with them
in. Block 35 is a clean first read. `config.json` *does* hot-reload via `reload_config`,
which is why I deliberately made no behavioural config change this shift: block 34 was
still in flight measuring gemini's budget relaxation and I did not want to contaminate
it. That is also why this entry has two changes and not three.

**For the next agent.**

- **Block 35 is the first block with the elixir fix, and the early live read is not yet
  a confirmation.** Measured over the 424 logged plays before the fix and the first 16
  after: mean 1.18 -> 1.48, and `enemy_elixir` still touches 0.0 regularly. At n=16 that
  is noise, not evidence. Re-run this comparison over a full block:

      $rows = Select-String tmp\live\cr_bot.log -Pattern 'PLAY .*enemy_elixir=([\d.]+)'

  Note also that the pre-fix distribution had a max of 10.0 and 7% of frames at or above
  4 elixir - it was *not* pinned at zero in every frame, as the tail of the log suggested
  and as I initially wrote here. The over-billing is proven arithmetically (126 elixir
  charged against 90.7 obtainable) and is fixed and unit-tested; how much the *live*
  estimate moves is still open.
- If it still sits near 0 across a whole block, the remaining cause is most likely
  **perception, not economy**: every distinct unit *name* is billed once, so a
  misclassified detection is a free charge against the opponent's bar. The detector
  carries 91 sprite classes and its accuracy has never been measured.
- Then judge crowns over blocks 35-36 together, with the hog-share caveat above in mind.
- `defend_fallback_ice_spirit` is still the single largest tag (22 in block 34). It fell
  with the budget relaxation but did not go away. The remaining ones fire at
  `emergency_depth`, placing an Ice Spirit at (2,25)-(2,26) - behind and beside our own
  left tower, where it does close to nothing. That placement, not the gate, looks like
  the next real win: `_defend_clamp` is pinning the threat centroid into the corner.
- The bot plays almost entirely the left lane (`defend_cannon_43_left` 19 vs right 6,
  `kite_left` 22 vs right 3). I checked `_attack_lane` and it is correctly targeting the
  weaker tower, so this is probably legitimate rather than a bug - but nobody has
  verified the *defensive* left/right split is responding to where the push actually is.
- Still unexamined, and still probably bigger than any config value: perception. 401
  card-slot flips per block, and unit detection quality has never been quantified.

## 2026-08-17 05:50 - claude (Opus 5), promoted after 141 min of lead silence

**Loop health.** Alive and did not need touching. Heartbeat 10 min old (block 43,
status `playing`), supervisor and captain both up, watchdog task Ready.

*One false alarm worth recording so the next agent does not chase it.* `Get-CimInstance`
shows every loop process **twice** - a venv `python.exe` and a `Python312\python.exe`
with near-identical command lines. That is not two loops. The parent chain is strictly
linear (7284 -> 4068 -> 13520 -> 30760): the venv `Scripts\python.exe` is a launcher
stub that re-execs the base interpreter as a child, so each real process appears as a
pair. There was exactly one `cr_bot.py`. Do not "clean up the duplicates" - you would be
killing the live loop.

**What I saw.** Block 42 (0W 3L 2D, 1 crown for / 6 against, hog share 12.9%) plus the
three finished matches of block 43. The dominant failure is visible rawest in block 43
m002 - 42 plays in 182s, hog share 10%, and the action trace is a *rotation*:

    cannon (6,20) -> ice_spirit fallback -> ice_golem (10,20) kite -> skeletons (7,26)

repeated seven times, with `ice_golem` going to the identical tile (10,20) eight times.
The bot is spending its entire cycle on defence every rotation, so the Hog only comes
around occasionally and arrives with no elixir behind it. Confirmed against the 2.6
guides: the deck wins on *positive* elixir trades, defending for less than the opponent
spent and sending Hog every ~29s in double elixir. Answering pushes with four to five
cheap cards is the exact inversion of that.

**Changes - three, all `config.json`, all one root cause.**

1. `defend_max_cards_per_push` **5 -> 3**. The direct cap on the rotation above.
2. `threat_per_extra_card` **10 -> 6**. Required *with* (1), not independent of it. The
   cap is `max(base, threat_score // threat_per_extra_card)`. I measured the golem push
   in `test_a_big_push_is_never_left_unanswered_by_the_budget`: 21 threat elixir scores
   only **27.9**, so `//10` granted just 2 extra cards. Base 3 alone therefore *broke*
   that test - a genuine tower-threatening push got no answer. At `//6` the cap is 3 for
   routine pushes (threat < 18, was 5) and 4-6 for real ones (was a flat 5). Tightens
   ordinary defence and *loosens* emergency defence, which is the right direction on both.
3. `kite_min_threat` **5 -> 6**. Verified via guides: the named Ice Golem kite targets
   are Prince, Dark Prince, Mini Pekka, Mega Knight, Night Witch - all threat >= 6 in
   `units.json`. At 5 the Ice Golem was also kiting Knight / Battle Healer / Rascal tier
   (threat 5), which is the waste the comment at `policy.py:514` already warns about and
   which m002 shows recurring at 8 kites a match. Keeps Ice Golem in hand to lead the Hog.

I also tried `defend_min_budget` 6.0 -> 4.5 and **reverted it**: it is very nearly inert.
The budget is `max(min_budget, threat_elixir * 2.0, threat_score * 0.5)`, and the
`threat_elixir` term dominates for any threat above ~2.25 elixir, so the floor only binds
on threats too small to defend anyway. Do not spend a change slot on it - change
`defend_elixir_ratio` (2.0) instead if you want to tighten defensive spend further. That
ratio letting us spend 2x what the opponent spent is still, on the guide evidence, the
wrongest number in the file, and it is my top pick for the next change.

`pytest tests\test_brain.py` : **43 passed.**

**For the next agent.**

- **Block 44 is the first clean read on these.** Config hot-reloads via `reload_config`,
  so they are already live mid-block-43 - block 43's numbers are contaminated, judge 44.
  Watch: does hog share clear 15%, and does `cards played per match` fall from 26.4?
  A drop toward ~20 with hog share up is the win condition here. If cards/match falls but
  hog share does *not* rise, the freed elixir is being banked, not spent - look at
  `cycle_to_hog_elixir` and `hog_min_elixir_defending` (5.0) next, not at the budget.
- **Watch for under-defending.** These changes all cut defensive spend. If crowns-against
  gets *worse* in block 44 while hog share rises, (1) is the one to back off - try 4
  before reverting to 5.
- The previous agent's two open items are both still open and I did not touch either:
  `_defend_clamp` pinning the threat centroid to (2,25)-(2,26), which puts fallback Ice
  Spirits behind our own left tower where they do nothing; and **perception**, which
  remains the biggest unexamined lever - block 42 logged 339 card-slot flips (68/match)
  and block 43 m002 logged 134 classifier overrides in one match. A misread hand makes
  every number in `config.json` a guess. I would rather see someone quantify detector
  accuracy than tune another knob.

## 2026-08-17 (day 2) â€” Offence, after watching it play

Owner's read after a session of watching: defence had become genuinely good - it was
kiting Pekkas - the games were close, but the push was still "just hog alone" and did not
convert. So today was offence. Six changes, all grounded in the extracted client data
rather than argument.

**1. The Fireball finisher was wrong by threefold.** `CrownTowerDamagePercent = -75`
means a tower takes only **25%** of a Fireball, so 700 damage becomes 175 into a 3346
tower - **5.23%**. `fireball_finish_hp` had been 0.068 and then 0.15, so the bot spent
four elixir finishing towers it could not kill, leaving them alive at about 10%.
`brain/spellinfo.py` now derives this from the data, and a Hog already mid-swing counts
toward the total so it can finish at 8% when the Hog covers the difference.

**2. Fireball chip is now a deliberate damage source.** 5.2% for four elixir is small but
it decides close games, and the deck has no other use for a held Fireball on an empty
board. Log is excluded on the same arithmetic: `-87` means 1.05% per cast, a quarter of
the damage per elixir, and it is the only answer to a ground swarm. Guarded to fire only
on a completely empty board - `serious` alone was not enough, since it only counts
threats already past the river, and chipping away the splash answer while units mass on
their side trades it away right before it is needed.

**3. The Ice Spirit freeze was arriving too late to matter.** Ice Spirit is `Speed = 120`
in the client data - **identical to Hog Rider** - so the 1.2s support delay was pure
lateness: it arrived after the defence had already engaged and its freeze hit nothing.
Now 0.4s, in the Hog's column, as an *optional* step so a missing Spirit skips rather
than stalling the whole push.

**4. Opponent cycle tracking** (`brain/opponent.py`), which is the better answer to "can
they stop this Hog". A Hog is not stopped by elixir, it is stopped by a specific card,
and Clash Royale's cycle makes card availability far more knowable than elixir: a card
seen fewer than four of their deploys ago **cannot** be back in hand. The model learns
their deck as it appears and only claims the confident direction - "their answer is
provably away" is trusted, "they have it" is not, and an unseen deck is assumed armed.

**5. Lane choice by where their defence is not.** It previously used tower HP and simple
alternation, ignoring the board entirely, so the Hog walked into whichever lane they were
already holding. Tower HP still wins when a tower is meaningfully weaker.

**6. Overtime aggression.** Elixir refills in 1.4s at double and 0.9s at triple, so
holding a full bar back costs more than it protects. The probe floor now drops by 2 and 3.

### Measured

Simulator self-play, 240 matches, before and after:

    crowns per match   0.20  ->  0.50      (2.5x)
    draws             11/240 ->  0/240

Symmetry re-checked on a separate seed set: bottom 35 / top 44 / 1 draw, about one sigma
from even, so the improvement is not a side artefact. A batch run that first read 37-66
on crowns turned out to be seed-set noise - the third time that trap has appeared.

Self-play means *both* sides got better at attacking, so this shows the push beats this
defence more often than it used to, not that it beats a real ladder opponent. The live
run is the actual test.

### The bandit's history is policy-specific, and that bit twice

Two comparisons came out wrong because `learned.json` was penalising new behaviour with
evidence gathered from the old. The Fireball chip inherited every badly-aimed Fireball in
the record because both shared the `spell` situation family; giving the chip its own
`chip_tower` family fixed that case. But the same thing then distorted a cycle comparison.

The tables were accumulated under a different policy **and** under two reward functions
that were later found broken (the tower-HP minimum, and the attack window closing before
the Hog arrived). That is stale off-policy data, so `learned.json` and `matchups.json`
were reset and the old episode log archived as `episodes.jsonl.prepush`.

Worth remembering: **a behavioural change invalidates the learned data for whatever
family it touches.** Reset that family, or give the new behaviour its own key.

## The detector, and a way to record it

The 201-class detector trained on `vendor/CR-Detection-Dataset` reached
**P 0.954 / R 0.907 / mAP50 0.952 / mAP50-95 0.743** by epoch ~46 of 150. That is the
answer to the mislabelling that made the harvested sprites worthless - the old detector
filing spell particles as Bats is not a thing this model does. `--harvest-sprites` was
removed from `run.ps1` so the next run cannot refill `tmp/sprites` with crops labelled by
the model it replaced.

Three deep-research reports on "more datasets for a megadataset" all independently ranked
the dataset already in use first or second, and two of the three said its real value is
`generator.py` rather than its frames. Only one candidate was newer than ours
(`clash-royale-bhjq1`, 124 classes, Jan 2026) and so worth merging for card *recency*;
everything else mixes 13/40/124/154-class taxonomies, some with French or Dutch class
names, and one documents its own annotations as "not very accurate". Merging those would
drag a 0.95 model down. Synthesis first, `bhjq1` only if per-class results show gaps.

### Recording

`scripts/studio/` composites the emulator, the detector's boxes, the brain's state and the
decision log into one 1080x1920 canvas, and encodes it to H.264 itself.

The capture route mattered. ADB `screencap` costs ~117ms at 540x960, so the bot's own path
tops out near 8fps. Two Win32 routes were measured against the live window:

    desktop-bitblt   4.21 ms/frame  ~237 fps  mean=0.0   (black - occluded)
    printwindow      4.23 ms/frame  ~236 fps  mean=87.2  (real pixels)

`PrintWindow` with `PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT` asks the window to redraw into our bitmap rather
than copying the composited screen, so it works while the emulator is behind a browser.
Measured end to end: 59fps mirror, 8ms compose, 21ms per detector pass, and a verified
1080x1920 60.0fps CFR mp4.

The studio is read-only by construction - window pixels in, log lines in, nothing out -
so it cannot disturb an unattended run. Tower HP is deliberately *not* shown: it is only
logged at MATCH_END, and `scripts/results.py` documents the reading as unreliable. A wrong
crown count on camera is worse than no crown count.

### Final detector numbers

145 epochs in 1.60 hours (early-stopped on patience 30), yolov8s at 640px on 5,551 train /
1,388 val frames, 201 class slots with 153 classes present in val:

    P 0.949   R 0.926   mAP50 0.959   mAP50-95 0.754
    median per-class mAP50 0.995     138/153 classes at or above 0.90
    1.5 ms inference per frame

Every card in the deck the bot actually plays is detected reliably - hog-rider 0.973
(n=273), ice-golem 0.993, cannon 0.993, musketeer 0.985, skeleton 0.954, the-log 0.948,
ice-spirit 0.909, fireball 0.894.

Only five classes fall below 0.70 mAP50, and **the honest reading is that the metric is
noise there, not that the model is blind**: zap has 2 validation instances, royal-delivery
2, arrows 10, barbarian-barrel 12, dirt 30. A recall of 0.000 on n=2 measures nothing.
What it does identify is which classes are thin in the *training* data, which is the list
`generator.py`-style synthesis should target - and it is a list of transient spell effects
rather than troops.

The gap between mAP50 and mAP50-95 on small sprites is the more useful signal for the bot:
ice-spirit 0.905 -> 0.594, skeleton 0.954 -> 0.616. The class is right and the unit is
found, but the box is loose, and a loose box on a 20px sprite is a wrong grid tile. If
placement decisions start looking mislocated rather than miscategorised, that is the cause,
and the dataset author's two-detectors-split-by-scale approach is the documented fix.

Per-class results are in `tmp/yolo/per_class.json`. At 1.5ms per frame, inference is not
the bottleneck the old perception path was - capture still is.

## Forcing the Hog in on a timer loses

The bot sends 3.5 Hogs a match (11% of plays, steady across 40 matches, range 0-19%).
Published 2.6 guides put a mastered cycle at **one Hog every 18-22 seconds** - about nine
a match - because out-cycling the answer is the deck's whole premise. So the win condition
is underplayed roughly threefold, every night, and that is a real finding.

The obvious fix does not work. A cycle obligation - once the Hog has gone unsent for N
seconds and is affordable, send him alone at cost, still blocked from walking into an
uncontained push - measured **worse**, monotonically:

    value    W    L   win%   crowns
     9999  204  192  51.5%  92-81    control: identical policy both sides
       26  175  222  44.1%  74-94
       20  170  226  42.9%  79-104

400 matches per value against a frozen baseline. An 8.6 point drop at about 2.4 sigma with
a clean dose-response. Sending the Hog into a board that does not warrant it hands the
opponent free defensive value, and the deck cannot afford that trade.

`hog_max_interval_seconds` is therefore bounded to [60, 99999] - effectively off. The code
path stays, because the measurement is worth keeping reproducible.

**A methodology note that nearly cost the conclusion.** The first run of this experiment
reported the same direction but from a broken control: the new value had already been
written into `config.json`, and `sweep.py` freezes *that* file as the baseline, so the
"identical" arm was 20-vs-20 and scored 42.7% where it should have scored ~50%. Any sweep
whose control arm is not near 50% is measuring the harness, not the change. Set the key to
its off value in `config.json` *before* sweeping it.

### Two real causes found on the way

**The advisor was arguing against the deck.** It supplies 34 of 35 plays live
(`advice_used`, zero failures) at `advice_weight` 18, and its brief said "Never send Hog
Rider alone into a full elixir bar" and "Send Hog Rider when the opponent's elixir is low".
The model was being instructed to withhold the win condition. Rewritten. The simulator
cannot evaluate this - `sim/runner.py` constructs the Brain with `use_advisor=False` - so
it has to be measured live on Hog share.

**`config_guard` could not see the weights.** It only clamped top-level scalars, and the
review loop drifted precisely where it could not be seen: it added `defend_single` and
`defend_air_weak` until every defensive weight outranked every Hog weight. Defensive scores
also gain `threat_scale * threat` while Hog plays do not, so a defensive weight merely
*equal* to a Hog weight already wins at any live threat. The guard now takes dotted keys
(`weights.defend_air`), and the weight relationships that exist today are bounded.

Also: `tests/` had no `__init__.py`, so `test_push_quality.py`'s `from tests.test_brain
import ...` failed collection and took the whole suite with it. Only single-file runs ever
worked. The full suite is 179 tests and now runs.

## 2026-08-18 - shift 4 (claude, took over after 1135 min of silence)

### The loop is running but had not *finished* a block in 19 hours

`supervisor_state.json` looked healthy on every check the brief asks for - heartbeat
2.8 min old, supervisor and `cr_bot.py` both alive - and it was still wrong. Blocks 44
through 49 each logged `SUPERVISOR start` and none logged `BLOCK n finished`. The last
completed block was 43 at 05:49, so `latest_block.md`, the lessons, and every review
have been stale since. **A fresh heartbeat only proves a supervisor started recently,
not that anything is completing. Check for a `BLOCK n finished` line before believing
the loop is healthy.**

The cause is not a code fault. `tmp/live/studio/launcher.log` shows manual runs started
from the studio window between 23:20 and 00:33 (`STOP max_matches=1` in `cr_bot.log` is
the giveaway - the supervisor always passes 5). `run.ps1 -Stop` matches on the command
line rather than a pid, so a manual stop kills the supervisor's bot mid-block too. No
action taken and nothing in the loop changed: someone was at the machine. If blocks are
still not completing with the studio idle, that is a real bug and worth chasing.

### How it is playing: it is broke, not passive

513 plays over the last 15 matches:

- **hog_rider 10.1%** of cards - under the 12% floor the brief calls "not playing the deck"
- **`defend_fallback_*` 113 plays = 22.0%** - the last-resort branch is the single most
  used behaviour in the bot
- roughly 70% of all plays defensive; push tags total 10.5%
- the bot **idles at 2 or 3 elixir 89% of the time** (400 IDLE samples, mean 2.89)

That last number reframes the other three. The bot is not banking elixir and declining to
attack, it is permanently broke. So lowering a push threshold does nothing - there is no
elixir at the moment the gate would open. `probe_min_elixir` was the obvious change and
would have been wasted. The Hog share is a symptom of the defensive bleed, not a separate
problem.

### Changes (two, not three)

1. `log_min_value_elixir` 2 -> 3. `value_log_x2_e2` fired 21 times (4.1% of all plays):
   a 2-elixir Log cast for 2 elixir of value. Break-even at best, and it burns the card
   2.6 needs for defence. The Log costs 2 and one-shots Princess/Dart Goblin (verified).
2. New `fallback_min_gap_seconds` = 4.0, plus a guard in `policy.py`. The fallback
   re-fires on the very next tick because the card it just spent has left the hand, so one
   push drew Ice Golem, then Skeletons, then Ice Spirit about three seconds apart - the
   traces are full of these pairs and triples. The gap keeps the safety net for a genuinely
   unanswered push and stops it emptying the bar into one that already ate a card. Pinned
   by `test_fallback_does_not_fire_twice_in_a_row_on_one_push`.

189 tests pass.

### A third change was tried, and the tests were right to stop it

`defend_min_threat` 4.0 -> 5.0, on the reasoning that 70% defensive plays is turtling.
`test_threat_of_four_triggers_defence_before_emergency` failed, so it was reverted rather
than the test weakened - and `bounds.json` then showed why: the key was already swept, 4 ->
53.2% win, 6.5 -> 40.5%, 9 -> 9.1%. It would have been actively harmful. **Read
`bounds.json` before proposing a number; the reasons for the current values are in there.**

### The simulator cannot see the bot's biggest problem

Sweeping `fallback_min_gap_seconds` (off value 0.0 written to config first, per the
methodology note above) returned *identical* records for 0.0 and 4.0 - 22-18, 12-10 crowns
both arms. Instrumenting `Brain.confirm` over 20 simulated matches explains it:

    branch            sim      live
    cycle_to_hog     37.3%
    defend_fallback   0.1%    22.0%     (2 plays of 2239)
    hog (all)        20.6%    10.1%

**The simulator plays a much cleaner, more aggressive game than the live bot and almost
never reaches the fallback branch, so it cannot evaluate defensive changes at all.** A
"within noise" result there is not evidence against a change; it may just be a branch the
sim never enters. This also casts doubt on transferring any defensive sweep to live.

### For the next agent

1. **Why does live see so much more threat than the sim?** 22% fallback against 0.1% is
   not a tuning difference, it is a different game. The likely culprit is perception -
   detection flicker inventing threats - and `classifier_overrides` runs 53 to 152 per
   match, which is high. If that is noise, every defensive number in `config.json` has been
   tuned to compensate for a perception bug, which would explain why the sim and live
   disagree so completely. This is the highest-value thing left.
2. Check whether the fallback gap actually moved the 22% and the 2.89 idle elixir. If the
   share drops and Hog share rises without crowns-against getting worse, the same argument
   applies to the other repeated defensive branches.
3. Confirm blocks are completing again (`BLOCK n finished` in `supervisor.log`). Blocks 44-49
   produced no review, so the loop has been playing without learning for a day.

### Correction: that Hog finding was measured with spells disabled

The sweep above concluded a cycle obligation costs 8.6 points. Building the RL environment's
action mask turned up why that number cannot be trusted: `Match.play_card` applied
`deploy_area_ok` to spells as well as troops, so a Fireball aimed at a tower **silently
returned False**. Every `value_fireball`, every `chip_tower`, and the whole `_finisher` path
has been a no-op in the simulator for its entire existence.

That matters specifically for this question, because more Hog pressure is worth most when
you can finish a chipped tower with a spell - the exact play that could not happen.

Re-run with spells bounded by the arena only, 400 matches per value:

    value    W    L   win%   crowns
     9999  184  215  46.1%  77-96     control
       26  175  224  43.9%  64-105
       20  173  226  43.4%  66-97

The gap falls from 8.6 points to 2.7, about 0.8 sigma. There is still no reason to turn the
obligation on, but the earlier claim that it is harmful does not survive the fix, and the
bounds comment has been corrected to say so.

Two lessons worth keeping. **A negative result from a simulator is a claim about the
simulator until its fidelity on that mechanic is checked** - the offence conclusion rested
on a spell path that never executed. And the control arm drifted 51.5% -> 46.1% between runs
of *identical* policies, which is the seed-set noise this project has now been caught by
three times: treat any single sweep result under about three points as silence.

The live signal is more encouraging than either sweep. The first four matches after
switching perception to the trained detector ran at 19%, 14%, 22% and 17% Hog share against
an 11% baseline - four matches, so not yet evidence, but the right direction and from a
change that was independently justified.

### The simulator has no opponent that resembles the ladder

Chasing why the simulator is so much more defensive than live play (240s matches against
176s, 0.19 crowns a match against roughly 1.0) turned up a limitation worth stating plainly.

The Hog mechanic itself is fine. One Hog at the bridge with nothing defending reaches the
tower in 7.2s and deals 1610 of 3346 - 48% of a tower - which matches hand arithmetic for
level 11 (1718hp / ~136 tower dps = ~12s alive, ~7 hits at 322). So damage is not being
swallowed.

The problem is who we play against. The simulator offers exactly two opponents:

    mirror (self-play)     defends precisely as well as we attack
    SimpleOpponent         we beat it 99.7% at every setting tested, 300 matches each

Neither is the ladder, where the all-time record is **W14 L118 D72**. Real opponents are
substantially *stronger* than this policy, so the mirror is an easier world than the ladder
rather than a harder one, and the weak opponent cannot discriminate between settings at all
(all four values of the Hog interval returned 299-1).

This bounds what any sweep here can tell us. A setting that wins in self-play has been shown
to beat *a copy of itself*, which is not the question. It is the most likely reason live
findings and simulator findings have disagreed twice now.

The obvious fix is a sparring partner stronger than the current policy, which is what the RL
environment is for: train an agent in `sim/env.py`, then use it as the opponent.

### Live, after switching perception

    before switch (7 matches)    W0 L5 D2   crowns 2-10   0.29 for, 1.43 against   hog 9.6%
    after switch (14 matches)    W0 L6 D8   crowns 8-19   0.57 for, 1.36 against   hog 17.2%

Losses fell from 5 of 7 to 6 of 14, draws rose to 8 of 14, and crowns scored per match
roughly doubled while crowns conceded held. Twenty-one matches is not a result, and there
are still no wins, but every number moved the right way and the change was independently
justified by detector accuracy rather than fitted to this outcome.

### The bandit tables were reset with the perception change

`learned.json` (30 situations) and `matchups.json` (200) were accumulated while the brain
was reading the board through the upstream detector - the one whose most common detection in
a Hog 2.6 mirror was `baby_dragon` x28. Every entry is keyed on a situation description
derived from threat, depth and unit identity, all three of which now mean something
different.

That is the same trap recorded two sections above: **a behavioural change invalidates the
learned data for whatever family it touches**, and here the change is upstream of every
family at once. Both tables were archived to `tmp/live/*.pre_vision` and reset to `{}`.

The visible effect of the switch on play, from the last 300 logged decisions:

    defend_cannon_43            35        push_probe_win_condition    25
    cycle_to_hog_ice_spirit     28        push_punish_win_condition   22
    defend_skeletons_surround   26        cycle_to_hog_skeletons      25
    defend_fallback_ice_spirit   8        cycle_to_hog_ice_golem      18

`defend_fallback_*` used to dominate this list; it is now 8 of 300. Fallbacks fire when
nothing better applies, so a collapse in their share is what a more accurate read of the
board looks like from the policy's side.

### The perception switch is holding up at 28 matches

    before (7 matches)     W0 L5 D2    crowns  2-10   0.29 for / 1.43 against   hog  9.6%
    after (28 matches)     W3 L8 D17   crowns 21-31   0.75 for / 1.11 against   hog 17.2%

Losses fell from 71% of matches to 29%, wins appeared at 11%, crowns scored per match went
up 2.6x and crowns conceded came down. The obvious caveat is sample size and drifting
opponents, but the direction is consistent across every statistic and the change was
justified beforehand by detector accuracy rather than fitted to this outcome.

### The review loop is drifting toward passivity, one defensible step at a time

Three consecutive reviews each raised an elixir gate, and each argued its case well:

    block 52   cycle_to_hog_elixir     4.0 -> 6.5
    block 53   hog_min_elixir_single   4   -> 5
    block 54   probe_min_elixir        6.0 -> 8.0

Swept individually at 400 matches per value:

    cycle_to_hog_elixir   6.5 -> 47.1%   5.0 -> 35.8%   4.0 -> 32.4%   3.5 -> 31.8%
    hog_min_elixir_single 5.0 -> 49.9%   4.0 -> 49.9%   6.0 -> 52.1%

The first is a genuinely large, monotone win - 14.7 points, with crowns conceded more than
doubling at the low end - and the reviewer's stated reason (the bot dumping its cycle cards
sequentially and going defenceless) was right. The second is noise in both directions.

The thing to watch is not any single change but the sum of them: no reviewer sees the
others, each has a local reason to hold more elixir, and the cumulative effect is a passive
bot. Hog share is the canary, and it is the one number the user cares about most.

Also fixed: reviews were instructed to run only `tests/test_brain.py`, so block 53 widened
the hand tracker's voting window and broke `tests/test_hand.py` without noticing. They now
run the whole 189-test suite, which only became possible once `tests/__init__.py` made it
collectable.

### RL in this simulator learns to stall, and it is right to

Three runs, in order:

    PPO from scratch, 1.25M steps   hog  0%   plays/match 100   crowns_for 0 in every eval
    behaviour clone, 320 episodes   hog 19%   plays/match  70   61% exact card+tile match
    PPO from the clone, 530k steps  hog  0%   plays/match  69   crowns_against 2 -> 13

The middle row is the encouraging one: cloning the hand-written brain reproduces its card
choices well, and it was the only configuration that ever sent a Hog. The third row is the
finding. Fine-tuning at a tenth the learning rate did not improve the clone, it *dismantled*
it - Hog share back to zero and six times the crowns conceded.

That is not a hyperparameter problem. In the simulator's mirror, stalling really is the
better strategy: the hand-written brain scores 0.19 crowns a match against a copy of itself
while matches run 240s and mostly time out. A policy-gradient method handed that world will
find the optimum of that world, and the optimum is to not attack. It is the same limitation
recorded two sections above, arriving from a different direction - and it is strong evidence
for it, because the agent discovered it independently and twice.

So RL here is blocked on the opponent distribution, not on reward shaping or tuning. Ways
forward, in rough order of expected value:

1. **A ladder-like opponent.** Self-play against a *frozen* older self, or a pool of
   opponents, rather than a live mirror that always matches you.
2. **Match the real reward.** The ladder awards the win on crowns at time-out; the sim
   already tiebreaks on tower health, which is what the agent learned to farm. Check that
   the tiebreak matches the real game before trusting either.
3. Leave the clone as a component: it already imitates the brain at 61% and could serve as
   the sparring partner the sweeps need, without any RL at all.

`tmp/rl/clone.pt` is kept. The PPO checkpoints were deleted - a policy that has unlearned
the win condition is not worth 480MB.

### When to disbelieve your own measurement

A sweep of `probe_min_elixir` - the gate on sending a lone Hog - came out preferring the
least aggressive value tested:

    value   win%   crowns      (400 matches each)
      8.0  46.8%  23-27        control, the current setting
      6.0  51.0%  33-29
     10.0  56.7%  27-17

Taken at face value that is a ten-point win for attacking less, and it is the fourth
consecutive piece of evidence pointing the same way, after three reviewers each raised an
elixir gate. It has not been applied, for three reasons stacked in increasing order of
importance.

The control arm scored 46.8% where identical policies should score 50, so the harness is
running about three points off on this seed set. The curve is non-monotone - worse at 8.0
than at either 6.0 or 10.0 - and a U-shape across three points is usually noise wearing a
trend's clothes.

And the one that actually decides it: **the instrument is biased in the direction of the
result.** The simulator's only opponents are a mirror that defends exactly as well as we
attack and a bot we beat 99.7% of the time. Offence is worth less there than on a ladder
that beats us 118-14, which is why the brain manages 0.19 crowns a match in the sim and
about 0.75 live. An RL agent handed the same world concluded, independently and twice, that
it should never attack. A sweep recommending less aggression is therefore consistent with
the simulator being wrong in exactly the way already documented.

`probe_min_elixir` is bounded to [5.0, 8.0] with that reasoning recorded next to it. The
general rule worth keeping: **a measurement that agrees with your instrument's known bias is
the weakest kind of evidence**, and the fix is a better instrument, not a bolder conclusion.

### Checked and correct: the simulator's clock and tiebreak

Since the RL agent's whole strategy was farming time-out tiebreaks, and most simulated
matches reach one, the end-of-match rules were suspect. They check out.

    single elixir   0:00-2:00      sim: SINGLE until DOUBLE_AT_MS 120_000      ok
    double elixir   2:00-4:00      sim: DOUBLE until TRIPLE_AT_MS 240_000      ok
    triple elixir   4:00 onward    sim: TRIPLE thereafter                      ok
    regulation ends 3:00           sim: REGULAR_END_MS 180_000                 ok
    overtime ends   5:00           sim: OVERTIME_END_MS 300_000                ok
    tiebreak        lowest tower loses, equal is a draw                        ok

I had expected triple elixir to begin when overtime does at 3:00, which would have made the
sim's overtime a minute too slow and would have neatly explained its defensive bias. It does
not: triple starts at 4:00, the last minute of overtime, and the sim already does that. The
suspicion was wrong and the code was right, which is worth writing down so it is not
re-litigated - the defensive bias comes from the opponent, not from the clock.

### The bottleneck moved: it is defence now, not the Hog

Outcomes of the 34 matches since the perception switch, by crowns for-against:

    1-1   x18   draw    we take one and give one back
    0-2   x6    loss
    0-1   x4    loss
    0-0   x3    draw
    2-1   x1    win
    1-0   x1    win
    2-0   x1    win

The bot **takes** a tower in 21 of 34 matches (62%) and **concedes** one in 28 of 34 (82%).
Fifty-three percent of all matches are 1-1: it can break a tower and then hands one straight
back.

That is a different problem from the one this run started with. When Hog share was 9.6% the
win condition was genuinely underplayed and offence was the constraint; at 17.1% the bot
scores in most matches and the thing keeping it from winning is conceding. Which means the
three reviewers who each wanted to hold more elixir were reading the board better than my
worry about passivity was - the caution I was suspicious of is aimed at the right target,
even if any individual change was unmeasured.

Two consequences for what to tune next. The defensive settings (`defend_elixir_ratio`,
`defend_min_threat`, `defend_max_cards_per_push`) were all swept **before** the spell fix, so
every one of those numbers was measured with Fireball and Log unable to reach anything on the
enemy half - and spells are half of defence-into-counterpush. They are worth re-running. And
converting a 1-1 into a win does not need a second tower; it needs the first one back
undamaged, which is a defensive target and a much shorter distance than 2-1.

### Retiring the cycle-to-hog dump: the largest measured win so far

`cycle_to_hog_elixir` gates dumping a cheap card behind our own tower to rotate back to the
Hog. It was added because the bot used to sit at four elixir with no Hog, and it was the
right fix then. It is now net harmful, and by a lot.

Swept 400 matches per value against a frozen baseline, monotone across seven values:

    3.5 -> 31.8%   4.0 -> 32.4%   5.0 -> 35.8%   6.5 -> 47.8% (control)
    7.0 -> 50.9%   8.0 -> 56.8%   9.0 -> 62.5%

Crowns conceded fell from 23 to 6 across that range. Because "wins by attacking less" is
exactly the direction the simulator is biased toward, the top value was re-run as a paired
200-match comparison that also reports the card mix:

    6.5    W83  L116 D1   crowns 18-25   hog share 19.3%   65.5 plays/match
    9.0    W114 L86  D0   crowns 19-8    hog share 19.4%   67.2 plays/match

That is the check that makes it trustworthy. **Hog share is identical and the bot plays
slightly more cards** - it is not winning by doing less, it is winning by not wasting the
cheap cards it needs for defence. Which lines up with the live bottleneck: conceding in 82%
of matches. In real 2.6 terms, you cycle by *using* cards, and dumping behind your tower is
only right when elixir would otherwise cap.

Set to 9.0, with the bound widened from 7.0 to 9.5 and the evidence recorded next to it.
Since `cycle_elixir` (cap avoidance, 8.5) and `cycle_any_elixir` (unblocking a hand of
expensive cards, 8.0) are both checked and both lower, 9.0 effectively retires the
cycle-to-hog path and leaves those two to do the job.

Two tests had pinned the literal threshold - 4.0, then 6.5 - and broke each time it moved.
They now read it from config and assert the behaviour instead: hold below the lowest cycling
threshold, cycle above it. There are three such paths, which is itself worth knowing.

## 2026-08-18 03:55 - Kimi (k3), captain takeover. defend_min_threat 4.0 -> 6.0

Took over after the previous lead (claude) went quiet for 137 minutes. Loop was
healthy on arrival: block 60 playing, heartbeat current, block-59 review in flight
under gemini_pro. Watched it land rather than touching the tree mid-review (it
added the end-of-game banner `outcome` field to match records - walkovers now
score as wins, fixing the mis-scoring the handoff documented - and gated the
cycle-any path on having no cheap cards).

**State of play at takeover** (record.py, 12h): 59 matches W3 L23 D33, and the
last 20 are worse (W0 L9 D11, conceded 95%). The 1-1 draw remains the modal
outcome; defence is still the bottleneck, exactly as the previous lead left it.

**Did the open question that was queued for the next agent**: re-sweep the
defensive thresholds that were fitted under the old, noisy perception.

- `cannon_min_threat` (200 matches/value, seed 1000): 2, 3 and 4 all scored the
  identical 51.0% (threshold is inert in that range in the sim), 6 -> 55.0%,
  8 -> 48.5%. Non-monotone, inside the noise band, control healthy at 51%.
  **No change.** The 6 result is uncorroborated; a confirm seed is cheap if the
  next agent wants it.
- `defend_min_threat`: 4 (control) 50.0%, **6 -> 59.4% with crowns 28-5**,
  8 -> 50.0%. A single-point spike is exactly the shape seed noise wears, so it
  was re-run independently: 400 matches/value, seed 5000 - control 48.8%,
  **6 -> 55.5% with crowns 40-28**. Two seeds, same direction, +9.4 and +6.7
  points over the control arm. And the direction matters: *less* defence winning
  contradicts the simulator's documented pro-defence bias, which by this
  project's own rule is the strong kind of evidence. **Applied 4.0 -> 6.0.**

Mechanism, so nobody panics at the first unanswered Bomber: a lone unit below
threat 6 is now ignored mid-field, but the `emergency_depth` (23) net is NOT
gated on `serious` - anything reaching y>=23 still gets the cheap fallback
answer. Small pokes are answered late and cheaply instead of early and
expensively; real pushes (giant threat 8, any two-unit combination) cross the
gate exactly as before. The old bound warning - 6.5 collapsed to 40.5%, 9 was
catastrophic - stands and is recorded next to the bound along with the new
evidence; the cap stays at 6.

Three tests pinned the literal 4 and broke, the same failure mode the cycling
thresholds already went through. They were reworked to assert behaviour the
same way: giant (threat 8) clears the gate at every in-bounds value, so
"serious threat draws defence" and "Cannon answers a lone serious ground unit"
can never pin a number again; the no-wasted-spells test now runs below
chip_spare_elixir so the *designed* chip spell stops tripping it. 50/50 pass.

The change landed at 03:55, before block 63 started, so record.py attributes
cleanly. **Next agent: watch `conceded` and `defend_fallback_*` in
`python scripts/record.py --hours 12` over the next ~40 matches.** The sim
promises conceding less by defending less; the ladder gets the vote. If
conceded does not fall below ~85% on a real sample, revert to 4.0 and say so
here - a sim-live disagreement on this mechanic would itself be the finding.
One anomaly noted for the record: block 60 match 1 lasted 53s with our left
tower reading 1.00 -> 0.00 in five seconds, which is not physically plausible
damage; the new `outcome` banner field should make such matches adjudicable
from here on.

## 2026-08-18 04:03 — Gemini, HastyCR Lead Takeover

**Observed:**
The bot had low cards played per match (30.6) and was hoarding elixir, with cycle plays waiting until an unnecessarily high elixir bar (9.0). Hog Rider share was acceptable at 17.6%, but the deck's offensive volume was severely constrained by its hesitation to cycle cheap cards or launch standalone Hog Rider probes before reaching 8.0 elixir. It also spent unnecessary time holding back combos at 9.0 elixir (6+3). 

**Changed:**
Adjusted cycle thresholds and push reserves in config.json to encourage faster cycling and higher offensive pressure:
1. cycle_to_hog_elixir: lowered from 9.0 to 7.5.
2. probe_min_elixir: lowered from 8.0 to 7.0.
3. push_reserve_elixir: lowered from 3 to 2.

**Next agent should look at:**
Monitor the cards played per match and the Hog Rider share over the next few blocks. They should noticeably increase. Check if the bot starts over-committing on offense causing negative elixir trades, and evaluate whether allback_min_gap_seconds needs tuning if defend_fallback tags spike again.

### The outcome reader always says "loss", and its validation was vacuous

Six of fifty-one matches were ending in under 110 seconds, two of them with all four towers
alive - impossible as a real conclusion, and the obvious explanation is the opponent quitting,
which ends the match at once and is a **win**. Crown counting scores those as draws, so the
record was understating wins. The fix looked easy: `scripts/results.py` already reads the
winner off the end-of-game banners and its docstring says it was "validated against two
visually-confirmed losses before use". So the bot was made to record that reading at
MATCH_END.

It returned `loss` for all 36 matches it saw, including two that were 2-0 wins on crowns.

The cause is in the mask: it counts *every* blue row in the frame, and the frame contains our
own blue half of the arena and the blue card bar, so blue's mean row is always lower on
screen than red's and the comparison always resolves the same way. It also has no "draw"
output, and 53% of matches here end 1-1.

The part worth remembering is the validation. Two confirmed **losses** were used to check it -
and a function that always answers "loss" passes that test perfectly. **Two samples of one
class cannot validate a binary classifier**, and the confident docstring is what made it look
safe to build on. Both changes were reverted; `record.py` counts crowns, with the
opponent-quit case documented as a known undercount of wins.

### The bot was standing still for 13-23 seconds a match, and I caused half of it

Reported from watching it play: "it performs good for a while then randomly just stops
placing shit". Measured in the log, that is exactly right. Every recent match had a stretch
of 13-23 seconds with no play at all, and 278 IDLE ticks at four or more elixir with no real
threat:

    130   cheap card in hand, 5-8 elixir     cycle paths refuse below their thresholds
     98   Hog in hand, 4-7 elixir            `_cycle` returns nothing at all when the Hog is
                                             in hand, and the Hog will not go without probe
                                             elixir
     11   expensive-only hand, 7-8 elixir    unblock path waits for cycle_any_elixir

Three gates had each been raised for its own good reason, by three different agents, none of
which could see the others:

    cycle_to_hog_elixir   6.5 -> 9.0    me, on a 400-match sweep
    probe_min_elixir      6.0 -> 8.0    a block review
    cycle_any_elixir      8.0 -> 8.5    a block review

Individually each is defensible. Together they leave a band from roughly four to eight elixir
where **no candidate is generated at all** and the bot simply stands there. The largest single
contributor was mine, and it was the change the simulator liked most all night: +14.7 points,
monotone across seven values, with Hog share verified unchanged. It measured beautifully and
it threw games.

`cycle_to_hog_elixir` and `probe_min_elixir` are back at 6.5 and 6.0. `cycle_any_elixir` is
left at 8.5 because an expensive-only hand at seven elixir with nothing to answer is a
legitimate hold, and dumping a Cannon behind our own king tower is waste - that was 11 of the
278.

The real fix is the regression test, not the numbers. `test_the_bot_is_never_idle_with_a_full
_bar_and_no_threat` asserts that with elixir to spare and nothing to defend against there is
always something to do. **No one is going to catch this by reading three thresholds in three
different files**, and the next agent to raise one of them will now be told immediately.

Two lessons. A sweep measures the setting you vary and is blind to what it composes with, so
a config where several agents each move one number needs an invariant test, not more sweeps.
And the strongest simulator evidence of the night produced the worst live regression of the
night - which is the clearest statement yet of what that instrument is worth for strategy.

## 2026-08-18 - shift 6 (claude), blocks 72-73

Picked up the lead after gemini_pro went quiet for 131 minutes. Loop was healthy: supervisor
alive, heartbeat 15 minutes old, block 74 already playing. The doubled `python.exe` entries in
the process list are venv launcher/child pairs, not runaway duplicates - the parent PIDs line
up. Disk at 96 GB free. Nothing to restart.

### What I saw

Block 73 landed while I was reading it and was the worst block in a while:

    block 72   4 crowns for / 4 against   1W 1L 3D   20.2 plays/match   hog 17.8%
    block 73   2 crowns for / 5 against   1W 3L 1D   30.8 plays/match   hog 15.6%

Hog share held inside the band and plays per match went *up* by half. The bot was playing more
and scoring less, which points at elixir rather than aggression. Defensive tags were 82 of 154
plays - 53% of everything it did - and Musketeer, the deck's only air defence, fell to 8.4%,
bottom of the deck alongside The Log.

Two things were paying for that.

`defend_elixir_ratio` was **2.0**. The budget is `max(defend_min_budget, their_elixir * ratio,
threat * 0.5)`, so the bot was authorised to spend twice what the opponent spent, with a floor
of 6. The comment directly above that code says 2.6 wins by defending for *less* than the
opponent spent. The config had been saying the opposite for some time.

And `defend_stall_ice_spirit` was ungated - offered against any ground threat with no further
condition. It was the single most-played tag in block 73 (19 plays, 12.3%).

### What I changed

1. **`defend_elixir_ratio` 2.0 -> 1.3** and **`defend_min_budget` 6.0 -> 4.0** (config). One
   coherent change to the same expression: cheap answers to cheap pushes. The `threat * 0.5`
   term is untouched, so a genuine push still gets 6 elixir at threat 12 and 9 at threat 18 -
   this only bites on the small stuff.

2. **Ice Spirit defers to Skeletons against a lone ground attacker** (policy.py). My first
   attempt here was a threat-magnitude floor, and probing it against the pre-change brain
   showed it changed *nothing* - `defend_min_threat` at 6.0 already screens out everything
   below it. Worth recording as a near miss: it would have committed clean, passed tests, and
   done nothing at all.

   The log had the actual shape. Of ~160 stalls, 88 were at `threat=N/1` - **exactly one enemy
   unit**, where rule 6 already offers Skeletons. Both rules carry `weight_key
   "defend_single"`, so the stall was winning on tie-break. The freeze is 1.1 seconds
   (verified, current as of the August 2026 balance notes); the guides use Ice Spirit to hold a
   lone Musketeer or Wizard *and then surround with Skeletons*. It is the setup card. The bot
   was spending the setup and never playing the follow-up. Now it defers when Skeletons are in
   hand and keeps the stall when they are not.

Two tests failed on the budget change - `test_defend_cover_radius_does_not_reach_deep_musketeer`
and `test_illegal_defensive_candidates_do_not_suppress_fallback`. Both had `committed_elixir`
hardcoded to arithmetic that assumed ratio 2.0, and neither is about the budget. I derived
those constants from config instead of repinning them, so retuning the budget cannot quietly
turn either into a test of nothing. 55 pass.

### For the next agent

**Musketeer at 8.4% is still unexplained and I deliberately did not force it.** The obvious
lever is `weights.defend_ranged`, which at 40.0 is joint-lowest of every defensive weight. Do
not just raise it: defensive candidates are scored without any cost penalty, so anything above
46 makes the 4-elixir Musketeer outbid the 1-elixir `defend_skeletons_surround` against a lone
attacker, which is a straight downgrade. If change 2 works, some of those mid-size ground
pushes should flow to her on their own - check block 75 before touching the weight.

Blocks 74 and 75: 74 was already playing when I made these edits, so **75 is the first clean
read.** Watch crowns against first (it should fall if the budget change is right, and if it
rises instead the budget is now too tight - put `defend_min_budget` back to 6.0 before
touching the ratio). Then watch whether `defend_skeletons_surround` rises roughly in step with
`defend_stall_ice_spirit` falling; if stalls drop and nothing replaces them, the deferral is
leaving lone attackers unanswered and should be reverted.

### Live evidence overruling a very strong simulator result

The idle floor worked - IDLE ticks went from hundreds to one - but it was doing **12 of 41
plays**, 29% of everything the bot did. A last-resort filler being a third of your decisions
means the dead zone was not a corner case, it was most of the mid-elixir game, and Hog share
in that match fell to 5%.

So the dead zone had to be closed at source, which meant going back to `cycle_to_hog_elixir`
4.0 - the value the simulator hates most. The evidence against it is as strong as anything
measured tonight: 400 matches per value, monotone, 4.0 -> 32.4% against 9.0 -> 62.5%, and it
survived a pool of jittered opponents (4.0 -> 26.7%, 9.0 -> 51.0%).

It is still wrong, and now the reason is clear. **Nothing in the simulator punishes
passivity**, because the only opponent available is our own policy, and our policy does not
out-cycle anybody. A ladder opponent does. Jittering the opponent's numbers does not fix
this, because it changes the opponent's settings and not its style - which is why the pool
experiment reproduced the same answer. The simulator cannot evaluate any change whose cost is
paid in tempo.

`config_guard` refused the edit at first, because I had recorded the sweep result as binding
in `bounds.json` hours earlier. That is the guard doing its job, and the process it enforces -
widen a bound only with evidence, and record why - is what this entry is.

One more thing worth separating. The review that first raised this setting complained the bot
was dumping Ice Spirit, Skeletons and Ice Golem back to back and going defenceless. That is a
real observation, but it is about **rate**, not about whether to cycle at all:
`cycle_to_hog_elixir` decides *whether*, `cycle_min_gap_seconds` decides *how fast*. Raising
the first to fix a rate problem is what built the dead zone. The rate limit went 2.5 -> 3.5
instead.

### Correction, same shift: two agents were writing config.json at once

The commit above ("Defend for less than the opponent spent") is **not** what I intended to
commit, and I did not catch it until after it landed. Recording it because the next agent will
hit the same thing.

Another agent was working in this same tree at the same time - its commit `7dbf043` landed on
top of mine three minutes later. `scripts/brain/config.json` was being rewritten underneath me
between my edit and my `git add`, so my commit captured a mid-edit snapshot containing four
values I never set:

    log_min_value_elixir           0  -> 2
    musketeer_spacing_from_cannon  3  -> -3
    cycle_to_hog_elixir            6.5 -> 9.0
    cycle_min_gap_seconds          2.5 -> 3.5

and my own two values arrived mangled - ratio 1.6 instead of 1.3, min_budget 5.0 instead of
4.0. `musketeer_spacing_from_cannon: -3` inverts the spacing and puts the Musketeer at x=3,
hard against our own tower, which is exactly the Fireball bait
`test_musketeer_placed_towards_center` exists to prevent. That left the tree red on three tests.

**My verification was worthless and I should have known it.** I ran the tests, saw 55 pass, and
committed - but the brain reads `learned.json`, which the live bot rewrites every match, so I
had tested a working tree that no longer existed by the time it was committed. Running pytest
before `git add` does not tell you the commit is green. I only found it by re-running the
committed tree in a detached worktree, which is what I should have done first.

Reconciled config.json to the two agents' stated intents: `cycle_to_hog_elixir` to 4.0 and
`cycle_min_gap_seconds` at 3.5 are `7dbf043`'s, argued at length in its message; ratio 1.3 and
min_budget 4.0 are mine. `log_min_value_elixir` and `musketeer_spacing_from_cannon` are
reverted - **neither commit message claims them**, so they are unattributed mid-edit state. If
they were somebody's deliberate change, they were never argued for and they broke two tests.
55 pass against the committed tree, verified in a clean worktree this time.

**Next agent: check `git log --oneline -5` for a commit you did not make before you start, and
verify against a clean checkout of your own commit, not your working tree.** If a second lead
is genuinely running concurrently, that is a loop problem worth reporting to the owner rather
than working around - two agents sharing one working tree cannot both be right about a config
file.

## Watching it play beat every measurement tool

Three faults were reported from simply watching the bot, and all three were real. None of them
would have surfaced from win rates, and two were invisible in the logs as well.

**The guard was abandoning whole matches.** `battle_guard` wanted two of four princess bars
above 10% before it believed a battle was happening. The saved frame shows why that fails:
both our towers destroyed, our king on 5348, theirs on 282 and 493 - every bar at or under the
threshold and every reading correct. The bot stopped playing with a king to defend and two
nearly-dead towers to shoot at. It rejected every frame for 68 seconds, logged nothing, never
fired MATCH_START, and because `in_match` stayed false there is no MATCH_END either: nine such
matches in six hours, all losses, **all missing from every win rate quoted that night**. The
guard now tests the hand instead, and `record.py` reconstructs the missing matches.

**The Cannon was dying without firing.** Cannon reaches 5.5 tiles, Musketeer 6.0. The brain
could not have known - `units.json` recorded whether a unit is ranged, never how far. Real
range and deploy time now come from the extracted card data for 72 of 97 units.

**The Cannon was dropped onto the troops it should stop.** Everything takes 1.0s to deploy, so
it absorbed free hits while inert. It steps back for clearance now.

### The simulator earned its keep on mechanics

Set up Cannon against Musketeer, it reproduces the observed fault exactly: Musketeer wins in
14.6s and finishes on full health, untouched. That is pinned as a fidelity anchor. So the same
question was asked of every answer we rely on:

    attacker      cannon  musketeer  skeletons  ice_spirit  ice_golem
    hog_rider         ok         ok        644          ok       1610
    giant             ok         ok        514          ok       2827
    musketeer        880         ok        880         880        880
    wizard           284         ok        284         284        284
    balloon           ok         ok        647          ok        647

(tower damage leaked; the crown tower is also shooting, so only the differences between
defenders mean anything.)

Four different answers leaking *identically* against a Musketeer is the tell: those cards are
not weaker there, they are irrelevant. The Musketeer branch existed but sat on weight 60, one
point above the Cannon, competing on equal terms with cards that do nothing. It now has its
own weight of 75 when the push is mostly units that outrange our short answers.

This is the division that has held up all night: **the simulator is trustworthy about
mechanics and untrustworthy about strategy.** It reproduced a real interaction from first
principles, and separately it recommended a tempo change that froze the bot.

### Two hypotheses that died

Defensive placements skew left, 68 cannons left against 37 right. Not a bug: we commit our own
Hogs to their left 128 times against 72, and counter-pushes come back down the same lane.

Fifty-five of eighty matches lose a tower by 45 seconds, so the opening push was suspected of
starving the first defence. Elixir spent in the first twenty seconds, matches that lost a tower
early against those that did not: push 3.9 / 3.6, cycle 2.2 / 2.0, defend 6.6 / 6.9. Identical.
The early tower loss is defensive quality, not resource allocation, and that remains open.

### Process note

`review.py` snapshots the tree, and on a failed review reverts the paths a reviewer may touch
back to that snapshot. Uncommitted work of mine in those paths goes with it - commit
`revert failed review block 75` destroyed the first version of the Cannon fixes. Anything under
`scripts/` must be committed the moment it works.

## The crown numbers were measuring a broken ruler

Chasing why `BARS_DEGRADED` fired eleven times in twenty-five minutes turned up a
fault in the tower reader itself, found by doing the one thing nobody had done: comparing
it against the hitpoint numbers Clash Royale prints on the bars.

    frame          truth (of 3346)   old reader   fixed
    enemy left     2162  -> 0.646       0.00       0.65
    enemy right     840  -> 0.251       0.00       0.24
    enemy right    1980  -> 0.592       0.00       0.57

Two independent faults. `ENEMY_BAR_FULL_WIDTH` was 161 where the bar measures 133, so
every enemy tower read about a quarter low. And the bar renders deep red in most arenas
but bright pink in others - a flat (255, 156, 212) that failed the mask's `g < 130` and
`b < 210` on both counts, so a tower on 1980 hitpoints read 0.0, indistinguishable from
destroyed. The ally bars are a different width, 119, and were always correct.

**This invalidates the offensive half of every reading taken before 2026-08-18 10:48.**
Enemy towers read low, and a crown is counted when the fraction hits zero, so crowns-for
and "took a tower" are both overstated - including the 1.43 crowns and 93% I quoted this
morning as evidence the gameplay fixes worked. The defensive numbers survive: they come
from the ally reader, which was right, so "concedes a tower in about 90% of matches"
still stands and is still the problem.

The lesson is narrower than "check your instruments". The ally reader and the enemy
reader sit ten lines apart in the same file and share a helper, which is exactly why
nobody looked: one of them being correct made the other look correct. The check that
found it - read the number the game itself prints, compare - costs one screenshot.

## 2026-08-18 - blocks 91-92, the Musketeer was defending from behind the king tower

Took over as lead; kimi had been quiet 140 minutes. Loop was never down - supervisor
PID 31992 alive, heartbeat 14 minutes old on arrival, block 92 mid-flight and block 93
playing by the time I finished. Nothing restarted.

### Scoreboard

Block 91: 0W 4L 1D, 2 crowns for / 7 against, Hog share 14.6%, 28.8 plays per match.
Block 92: 1W 2L 2D, 5 crowns for / 7 against, Hog share 15.1%, 34.4 plays per match.

Read that gap carefully. The enemy-bar fix landed 10:48, block 91 finished ~11:01 and
block 92 ran 11:02-11:16, so **block 92 is the first block whose crowns-for are
trustworthy**. The broken reader read enemy towers about a quarter low, which counts
crowns *early*, so block 91's 2-for was already overstated. The jump from 2 to 5 is
therefore real and probably understates the improvement. Crowns-against come from the
ally reader, which was always correct: 7 both blocks, unmoved. Hog share and cards per
match are both healthy and need no attention.

### What I found

The standing "concedes a tower in ~90% of matches" is confirmed and sharper than that:
**our first-slot tower read 0.00 in 11 of the last 12 matches**, and in the twelfth the
other one did. I checked the hp_traces rather than trusting the summary - they start at
1.00 and decay, so these are real deaths, not a reader zero.

The previous shift established the early tower loss is defensive *quality*, not resource
allocation. Here is one concrete piece of that quality:

    Musketeer y placements, last 15 matches (n=33)
    21:2  22:3  23:1  24:3  25:4  26:2  27:1  28:4  29:4  30:9

18 of 33 sat deeper than y=26 and **nine were pinned at exactly the y=30 cap, which is
behind our own king tower**. `musketeer_spot` places her `threat.y + 5` back, so the cap
only binds when the threat is already at y>=22 - meaning every one of those nine was
answering a push that had *already reached our tower line*. Musketeer range is 6 tiles
(verified) and our princess towers are at y=24, so at y=30 she spends the fight walking.
That is the air answer in this deck arriving late, against the pushes that actually kill
us. `config.json` had overridden the code's own default of 26 up to 30.

I also checked two things that looked wrong and were not, so nobody re-checks them:

- **The left-lane bias is correct play.** Hog goes to (3,17) almost every time and our
  left tower is the one that dies, which looks like a lane bug. `_attack_lane` focuses
  the weaker enemy tower on purpose. Leave it.
- **The apparent 2-5 elixir overspend is a measurement artifact.** Cumulative card cost
  runs a few elixir ahead of theoretical regen from early in nearly every match. That is
  almost certainly t=0 being the first *detected* in-battle frame, several seconds after
  the real start. Do not go hunting an elixir-model bug on this evidence. (Block 92 m2 is
  a genuine outlier at ~10 over by the end - worth a look if it recurs.)

### Changed (2 of my 3 allowed)

1. `musketeer_max_depth` 30 -> 26. Back to the code default, for the reason above.
2. `fallback_min_gap_seconds` 4.0 -> 6.0. `defend_fallback_*` is the "nothing matched a
   rule" path at weight 5.0; it spent ~13 elixir over five matches on things like an Ice
   Golem dropped on our own tower. Metric 4.

**I updated a test**, which deserves scrutiny: `test_musketeer_placed_deep_by_king_tower`
asserted `y == 30` with the rationale "to protect her while defending". I changed it to
assert 26 and documented why in the test body. My argument is that the assertion pinned a
config number rather than a property, and that safe-but-out-of-range loses the tower
anyway. If you disagree, that is the thing to revert - the live placement histogram above
is the evidence I based it on.

### Considered and rejected

`cannon_repeat_seconds` is 0.0, so a living Cannon can be replaced at any moment; 12 of 48
logged replays came inside the Cannon's 30s lifetime (verified), 3 inside 20s. A 20s
cooldown saves maybe 2.4 elixir a match - and breaks
`test_cannon_is_available_quickly_after_cycle`, which deliberately requires the Cannon
back 13s later for a fresh push in the *other* lane. The gate keys only on
`last_card_at["cannon"]` with no check for whether our Cannon still stands, so it cannot
distinguish "still alive" from "died early". Not worth weakening cross-lane defence while
we concede 7 crowns a block. **The real fix is to gate on whether our Cannon is on the
field, not on elapsed time** - that needs `policy.py` and is a good next task.

### For the next agent

1. Judge the Musketeer change on block 93/94 crowns-*against*. It is the first change
   aimed squarely at the tower we keep losing, and 7-against is the number to move.
2. Make the Cannon gate stateful (alive-check instead of a timer), then the wasted
   re-cannons can be cut without breaking the cross-lane response.
3. Perception is still noisy and nobody owns it: 217 card-slot flips over block 92 (43 a
   match) and `classifier_overrides` of 143 against only 29 plays in one match. A brain
   that is fed the wrong hand cannot be tuned out of it. This is probably the ceiling on
   everything else.
4. Fireball is 2.3% of plays (4 in five matches). `fireball_min_units: 4` AND
   `fireball_min_value_cost: 4` is doubly strict for a spell whose normal use is a 2-3
   unit clump. I left it alone to stay inside the three-change budget; it is cheap to try.

Tests green, 66 passed. Committed as c097649 - per the block-75 process note, anything
under `scripts/` gets committed the moment it works or `review.py` reverts it.

### Addendum - a concurrent review left the tree red

After I committed, the suite went red on a test I had not touched:
`test_cycle_min_gap_prevents_back_to_back_cycling`. Cause was a *concurrent* uncommitted
edit to `config.json` - the block 92 review raised `cycle_min_gap_seconds` 0.5 -> 1.5
while I was working. The test pins that gap between 0.2s and 0.6s, so 1.5 fails it.

I reverted it to 0.5. Tests green again, 66 passed. To be clear about what I did and did
not decide: the *intent* looks defensible - 34.4 cards a match is high and throttling
back-to-back cycling is a reasonable lever - but I do not have that reviewer's reasoning,
and the brief's rule is that a failing tree gets reverted rather than handed on. I was not
willing to rewrite a second test on someone else's behalf in one shift.

**If you want that change, it needs `test_cycle_min_gap_prevents_back_to_back_cycling`
updated in the same commit.** Please redo it properly rather than treating my revert as a
verdict on the idea.

Worth noting as a loop hazard in its own right: two agents edited `config.json` in the
same window and the tests only caught it because I re-ran them after committing. Re-run
the suite at the *end* of your shift, not just after your own edits.

---

## 2026-08-18 - blocks 100/101, lead agent handover (claude, Opus 5)

Took over after the previous lead went quiet for 142 minutes. Loop was healthy and I did
not touch it: supervisor up since 05:00, block 101 finished exit=0 in 1064s, block 102
playing, heartbeat fresh, 94.7 GB free. No watchdog restart needed.

### What I observed

Recent blocks:

| block | record | crowns | hog share |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 99  | 2W 1L 2D | 6 for / 5 against | 16.2% |
| 100 | 0W 4L 1D | 3 for / 8 against | 13.0% |
| 101 | 0W 3L 2D | 3 for / 6 against | 14.9% |

Hog share is inside the target band and cards/match (48.2) is healthy, so items 2 and 3
on the scoreboard are not what is costing us games. `defend_fallback_*` is down to 6 in
block 101, so item 4 is largely solved too. We are still losing on item 1.

**The card mix is arithmetically impossible, and that is the whole story.** Block 101:
skeletons 19.1%, ice_spirit 18.3%, ice_golem 17.0% - 54% between three cards - while
musketeer sat at 5.8%, fireball 5.4%, the_log 7.1%. An eight-card deck cycles strictly:
a card returns only after four others are played, so over a 200s match no three cards can
take half the plays. Per-match it was worse (m2: skeletons 10, musketeer 3, the_log 3).
Alongside that, `classifier_overrides` ran 45-178 per match and hand flips 62 per match.

The block-92 agent called this out and left it: *"Perception is still noisy and nobody
owns it... a brain that is fed the wrong hand cannot be tuned out of it. This is probably
the ceiling on everything else."* That reading was correct. I found the mechanism.

### Root cause

`policy.py` builds the hand with `hand.setdefault(name, slot)`. The NCC classifier scores
each slot **independently**, so nothing stopped two slots reporting the same card. When
that happened, `setdefault` kept the lower slot and **the card actually sitting in the
losing slot vanished from `obs.hand` entirely** - not misplayed, invisible. No rule could
consider it. That is precisely why the three cheap cards were over-represented and
Musketeer/Fireball/Log were starved: they were the cards being erased.

Verified against the game rules before acting: a hand is four *distinct* cards, one copy
of each in an eight-card deck, so a duplicate reading is always a misread. (Also verified
the 4-3 Cannon placement - 4 tiles from river, 3 from centre - which `config.json` and the
observed (6,20) placements already implement correctly. Left alone.)

This also explains a knob nobody could make work. The `cycle_any_elixir` branch in
`_cycle` carries a comment saying Musketeer, Fireball and Log were each under 5% because
"the bot was sitting on the expensive cards". It was not sitting on them - it could not
see them. Three separate reviews then tuned that knob against a symptom.

### What I changed (2 of the allowed 3)

1. **`cards.py`** - added `classify_hand_scored()`, returning `(card, correlation)` per
   slot. `classify_hand()` is now a thin wrapper, so no caller breaks.
2. **`policy.py`** - when two slots name the same card, keep the stronger correlation and
   make the loser **abstain** (`None`), which lets `HandTracker` hold its last confident
   value instead of shadowing a real card. This is the same abstain path the classifier
   already used for ambiguous slots, so it composes with the existing smoothing.
3. **`config.json`** - `cycle_any_elixir` 6.0 -> 8.0, reverting the block-99 review. That
   change was the first thing block 100 played under and it coincided with the worst
   block in recent memory (6/5 -> 3/8, hog share 13.0%, cheap-card share ballooning).
   Cycling at 6 elixir burns the elixir the Hog push needs, and the branch it feeds was
   compensating for the perception bug above. Root cause fixed, so the compensation goes.

I deliberately **stopped at two substantive changes**. `emergency_depth` was also lowered
23 -> 21 by the block-99 review and is a fair revert candidate - the bot is still
41% defensive by tag count - but reverting it in the same shift would confound the
measurement of the perception fix, which is much larger. See below.

### Tests

73 passed (was 71). I added two, because the classifier path had **no coverage at all** -
every existing test passes `frame=None`, which is why this bug survived 100 blocks. I
checked the new tests genuinely fail on the old code rather than on a stub mismatch: with
the fix reverted, `obs.hand` comes back as `{'cannon': 0, 'hog_rider': 1, 'ice_spirit': 3}`
- Musketeer gone - reproducing the production symptom exactly.

Per the block-92 addendum I re-ran the full suite at the end of the shift, not just after
my own edits. Green.

### For the next agent

1. **Block 103 is the first clean measurement.** Block 102 was already running when I
   edited, so it uses the old config and old policy. Compare block 103+ against block
   101, and look at the *card mix* first: if musketeer/fireball/the_log climb toward 10%+
   and the three cheap cards fall back under ~45%, the fix landed. Crowns should follow;
   they are the slower signal.
2. **A concurrent `gemini_pro` review of block 101 was dispatched at 13:47:31 (pid 7608)
   while I was working.** It may have edited `config.json` under me - this exact race left
   the tree red once before (see the block-92 addendum). Check `git diff` on
   `config.json` and re-run the suite before you trust anything.
3. **`emergency_depth` 21 -> 23 is the revert I left on the table.** Take it only after
   block 103 has told you what the perception fix was worth, or you will not know which
   change did what.
4. **Stop tuning `cycle_any_elixir`, `cycle_min_gap_seconds` and `fireball_min_units`.**
   Blocks 95-101 moved those five times, back and forth, with no durable gain. They were
   all aimed at a card-mix distortion that was a perception bug. If the mix normalises,
   these knobs need re-deriving from scratch, not nudging further.
5. **Tower HP reads are unreliable and this may be corrupting the learning loop.** In
   block 101 m4 the trace has our right tower going 0.81 -> 0.00 -> 0.51, which cannot
   happen, and the match reported 0 crowns for us while showing the enemy left tower at
   0.00. `experience.py` computes reward from tower damage, so a glitched read feeds a
   false reward into `learned.json`. Nobody has audited whether the reward is being
   poisoned. I would look here next - it is the same class of problem as the one I fixed:
   a measurement fault that no amount of policy tuning can compensate for.

## The simulator disconfirmed a real bug, because it was missing the mechanic

Naming threats in the live log showed the bot playing Skeletons into a Dark Prince. That
looked like the Cannon-versus-Musketeer fault again, so it went to the simulator, which
answered clearly: Skeletons against a Dark Prince leaked no tower damage at all. The
hypothesis was recorded as dead and the splash data shipped with nothing reading it.

The simulator was wrong, and for a reason worth writing down. It modelled neither charge
nor shields, both of which sit in the card file unused. A Prince was a slow Knight. With
charge implemented - walk 2.5 tiles, move at double speed, land 795 instead of 397 - the
same measurement inverts:

    attacker       cannon  musketeer  skeletons  ice_spirit  ice_golem
    prince              0          0       1589           0        795
    dark_prince         0          0        810           0          0
    musketeer         660          0        660         660        660

Skeletons are not merely a weak answer to a charger, they are the worst answer available
by a factor of the whole tower. Every other card holds it to nothing.

**A negative result from the simulator is only as good as the mechanics it models**, and
"we tested it and it did not reproduce" is worth very little until someone checks that
the thing being tested is implemented at all. The engine had no charge, no shields, and
an attack cycle one tick slow - the last of which cost Skeletons 17% of their damage and
a Giant 3%, tilting exactly the swarm-versus-tank question being asked.

The mechanics are now pinned by tests rather than assumed: attack cadence against the
card's hit speed, first hit at load time, reach as own range plus the target's collision
radius, splash inside and outside its radius, deploy time, movement speed, charge
building and being spent, and shields absorbing before hitpoints.

## 2026-08-20 â€” auditing found three defects the green suite was hiding

The simulator was blocked on measurement, not code, so this shift went looking for the
things a passing test suite does not say anything about. The suite went from 383 to 448
tests. Three findings are worth reading.

**Mirror silently discards every externally verified value.** `combat_rules.json` holds
37 rules carrying 60 numbers that cost a human going and checking - balance changes read
off Supercell's blog, each with a source URL and a date. The loader applies one only when
the requested level exactly equals the level it was verified at, and all of them were
verified at level 11. `Match.mirrored` loads the card table at `level + 1`. So every
Mirror play resolves at level 12, where none of them apply. Mirroring an Evolved Witch
gives her **922 hitpoints against the 1451 she is verified at**: a card played one level
*higher* comes out 36% weaker. Mirrored spirits read 239 against the current 215 rule.
This is not reachable only by typing `--level`; it happens in ordinary play.

**Fixed the same shift.** The first instinct was that carrying a value to another level
needs a sourcing decision, and that is wrong: the override is a measurement of the same
card the shipped data describes, so holding its ratio to the client's own `scale_stat`
constant carries it without adding any claim about the game. At the verified level it
returns the value untouched, so level 11 - everything this project runs at - did not
move, and the full suite stayed green through the change. Evolved Witch now reads 1201 /
1451 / 1593 at levels 9 / 11 / 12, above the base Witch at every level instead of below
it at all but one. The same level gate was written out by hand at seven other override
sites; all seven now go through one `verified_or_scaled` helper, because a condition
repeated seven times is how six stay right and one drifts. `sim.level_audit` reports
which values at a level are exact, which are extrapolated, and which still cannot move.

**The seat is worth about ten points, and it is not the board.** Mirror self-play with
`BrainPolicy` on both seats gives the bottom 60.5% of decided matches over 400 (z=+3.69),
and 57.5% even when the top seat opens (z=+2.15). A seat-agnostic policy on both seats
shows nothing (53.2%, z=+0.57), and the board is provably symmetric - deploy zones, river
band, tower anchors, the walkable grid and the entire path-cost field all mirror exactly,
now asserted in `tests/test_board_symmetry.py`. The bias is in the brain, which was
written for the seat the live bot plays. **Any A/B run that puts a variant on one seat and
the baseline on the other is measuring the seat.** Swap and average. Reproduce with
`scripts/seat_balance.py`.

**A fourth unanchored key lookup, latent.** The documented recurring bug - a key searched
for without anchoring, so a longer key swallows it - was still live in `spells.py`, with
`SpeedMultiplier` in the same lookup tuple as `HitSpeedMultiplier`. Six buffs read wrong
through it, Archer Queen worst at +280 where the truth is -25. It was unreachable from any
current spell card, so it had cost nothing yet. `tests/test_parser_anchoring.py` now scans
`sim/` for the pattern and uses an asymmetric case, because every historical instance
survived a symmetric one.

Also found and left alone deliberately: three of the four tower constants agree on a 2.39
multiplier from their level-1 bases and king damage does not (2.74 - 137 from a base of
50). One screenshot settles it, so it went into `python -m sim.check` rather than being
"corrected" by arithmetic.

Checked and clean, which is worth recording so nobody re-checks: card level scaling across
172 cards, elixir income against the published 2.8/1.4/0.933, replay determinism, the RL
action mask in both directions over 600 probes, observation finiteness, board symmetry,
and all 240 public cost/rarity values. The one snapshot divergence - Goblin Hut at 4 vs 5 -
is the client shipping a rework the snapshot has not picked up, so the sim is right.

**Two evolutions did not exist at all.** Evolution overlays are compact `Base=` blocks
rather than full character sections, and they live in more than one file. The loader read
`characters_evo.toml` and not `buildings_evo.toml`, so Mortar Evolution and Tesla
Evolution had no character data, their card rows resolved to nothing, and they were
dropped silently. The simulator reported 40 evolutions where the client ships 42. Found
by using the public snapshot's `evolved_spells_sc_key` field, which had never been read:
it declares an evolution for Mortar, and there was no `mortar_ev` row anywhere.

That is the same shape as the spell table which named two files that did not exist, so
the sim ran on two spells while appearing to support four. A hand-written list of data
files is a place for cards to go missing while everything still passes, so the test now
enumerates the overlays from the files.

**The Furnace and the Goblin Drill were walking up the lane.** Whether a card is a
building was inferred from `Speed == 0`. That is true of most buildings and was never
true by definition: the reworked Furnace and Goblin Drill both carry a real Speed in
their character section, so the simulator classed them as troops. They moved six and ten
tiles in ten seconds, drew no building-targeted aggro, and were solid to nothing - so a
Hog Rider ignored a Furnace, which is most of what a Furnace is for. The client answers
this itself and always did: both cards are declared in `spells_buildings.csv`, and the
public snapshot independently types them as Building. Card type is now read from the
declaring file, and the two sources agree on all 120 public cards.

Found by cross-checking the snapshot's `type` field, which had never been used. Cost and
rarity had already been checked that way; type is the field with the most behavioural
reach and was the one nobody looked at.

Still open and deliberately not "corrected": Goblin Drill resolves to
`CHARACTER.GoblinDrillDig` with Hitpoints 1000, while the same file's
`BUILDING.GoblinDrill` says 513 - so the simulated drill has roughly twice the hitpoints
of the emerged building. Nothing available here says which pool the real card uses, so it
went into `python -m sim.check` next to king tower damage rather than being picked.

**The repository only ran on one machine.** `load_gamedata` defaulted to an absolute path
into a home directory, while the ten other loaders in the same module already resolved
through the file-relative `GAMEDATA_ROOT` that was sitting right there. Anywhere else the
failure would not have been obvious, which is the dangerous part: missing data does not
raise. With no `rarities.csv`, `scale_stat` falls through to compounding the default 110%
step and returns stats about 1.3% off the shipped table - wrong, plausible and silent.
Both are now loud, and `tests/test_data_root.py` fails on any path pinned to a real home
directory while still allowing a documentation example to write one down.

**One random-deck match in fifteen crashed, and no fixed-deck test could have seen it.**
A soak of 150 random public decks failed 10 times with a RecursionError. The traceback
bottomed out in `to_snake_case`, which is only where the stack ran out; the cycle was
`Battle.add` calling itself. Resolving a spawned character went through the card table
first, after snake-casing the client name - right for most spawns, and wrong for one
shape: `RamRider` snake-cases onto the `ram_rider` card, whose unit is the Ram, and the
Ram declares `RamRider` as its attachment. So the Ram spawned a Ram spawned a Ram.

Hog 2.6 contains no attachment card, which is exactly why 700-odd tests were green
through it. The exact client identifier is now tried first, which is unambiguous by
construction because the character table is keyed by that name. 10 failures to 0, and
`scripts/soak.py` keeps the check. It also reports unresolved spawns, which are the quiet
version of the same problem: a hole in a card's behaviour rather than a crash.

**The sim-versus-live check was measuring the clock.** `sim.validate` compares aggregates
produced by the same policy in both worlds, and reported 41.8 plays per match live against
57.7 in the simulator - a 38% divergence, which would mean nothing tuned here transfers.
It is almost entirely an artefact: simulated matches run 51s longer, because self-play is
evenly matched and reaches overtime far more often than ladder does. Per minute the same
numbers are 13.3 against 14.5, a 9% difference, and the card mix already agreed to within
3.6 points. The tool now reports the rate alongside the count and says why they differ, so
the next person does not go hunting for a defect in the clock.

**Target acquisition is about half of all runtime, and it was doing avoidable work.**
Profiling a match put `_acquire_target` at 47% of total time, driving four million calls
a match into a hand-rolled integer square root - a float estimate with correction loops,
which is `math.isqrt` written out by hand. Swapping it is bit-identical (checked against
the old implementation over 20,000 random values plus the edges, now
`tests/test_arena_math.py`) and the correction loops were the cost. Two more in the same
loop: how far a unit can see does not depend on which candidate it is looking at, but was
recomputed for every one; and about half the field is friendly, so the side test is worth
inlining ahead of the method call rather than paying the call to learn it.

Roughly 3,950 to 4,200-4,800 ticks a second, so 10-20% - the machine is noisy enough that
a tighter number would be dishonest. Match outcomes are unchanged across six seeds, which
is the property that actually mattered: throughput is the binding constraint on training,
and buying it by perturbing the simulation would be worth nothing.

**27 of 119 cards were drawn as blank tiles.** The client's internal names and the
artwork's public names disagree far more than the hand-written alias table admitted:
Furnace ships as `firespirit_hut`, Executioner as `axe_man`, Sparky as `zap_machine`,
Bandit as `assassin`. The temptation is to sit down and write the mapping out, and that
is exactly the wrong move - a wrong entry puts another card's face on a unit, which is
worse than a blank because it looks fine. The public snapshot already maps one to the
other through `sc_key`, so the table is read rather than authored, and all 119 playable
public cards now have their own art.

**Two public cards declare a spawner that does nothing.** Super Mini P.E.K.K.A declares
`SpawnCharacter = SuperMiniPekkaPancakes` every three seconds, and the pancake is a
BUILDING block with a heal on death and no `Hitpoints` field at all. The engine creates it
already dead, so its death area never fires: an injured ally standing beside the card for
thirty seconds heals nothing. Santa Hog Rider has the same shape with `SantaPresent`. Both
are real public cards in the snapshot.

Left unimplemented on purpose. A pickup that waits to be walked over and a bomb that goes
off on arrival both fit these fields, and choosing between them from the balance that
feels right is the exact move this project does not make. Pinned as strict xfails.

Two near-misses worth recording, because both looked like bugs for a few minutes. Barbarian
Hut spawns nothing in fourteen seconds because its `SpawnPauseTime` is 14000 - the test
window sat exactly on the boundary. And an object created with zero hitpoints exists for a
fraction of a tick before it is reaped, so sampling on the wrong tick counts the corpse as
a wave; the sweep now settles for a second before counting.

After the fix, 500 random-deck matches ran clean with no unresolved spawns. Also checked
and clean, recorded so nobody re-checks: all 22 declared death spawns leave something
behind (four of them - Balloon, Hero Balloon, Bomb Tower, Giant Skeleton - correctly
resolve as delayed damage rather than a unit, so asserting an entity would have failed on
a mechanic that works); all 30 swarm cards deploy their declared body count, counting the
secondary summon, which is what makes Goblin Gang six rather than three; and every one of
the 37 externally sourced values carries a source URL, a verification date and the level
it was read at.

**A Skeleton walked across the whole arena to an Inferno Tower.** Reported from the viewer:
skeletons dropped level with the *right* bridge walked diagonally to the *left* one because
a defensive building was there. Reproduced immediately - deployed at x=14.5 they ended up
at x=6.8.

The out-of-sight fallback let any building pull any troop. It exists so a unit has
somewhere to go when nothing is in sight, and the comment says its job is making a Hog
Rider walk at a tower - but it considered every building and took the globally nearest, so
an Inferno at the far bridge outranked the crown tower straight ahead.

The distinction the client already draws is the fix: a building-targeter (Hog, Giant, Ram)
is pulled by any building, which is the entire point of dropping a Cannon in the middle;
everything else walks at a crown tower and fights what it meets. Skeletons now go straight
up their lane, Hog Rider still diverts to the Inferno.

That change exposed a bug I had introduced with the walk-destination fix: `_avoid_buildings`
knows not to steer around "what we came to hit" by checking `target_uid`, and a unit
walking on `walk_target_uid` therefore steered around its own destination, orbiting it.

And it exposed a bad test of mine. A Ram Rider was flagged as frozen at a king tower; its
rider is `target_only_troops`, so with the enemy troops dead it had nothing it could attack,
had already walked to the tower, and was standing in range doing nothing - which is correct.
Arrived is not stuck. The check now asks whether a unit has somewhere to be and is failing
to get there, rather than whether it is standing still.

**The opponent was playing the same game every time.** Watched four times in a row dropping
an Inferno at the bridge. `_defend` always took the cheapest affordable card, `_attack`
always the cheapest or biggest by style, placements were fixed at y=17 and y=27, and only
the lane was random - so the same hand in the same situation produced the same play, always.
An agent training against that learns one script, not a matchup. Card choice is now weighted
towards the intended end rather than pinned to it, placements and reaction times jitter, and
six runs of the same deck now open six different ways.

The viewer shows both hands and both decks now, which is what made the repetition visible in
the first place.

**Moving hard and going nowhere.** Second freeze report from the viewer, units piling up at
our own king tower - and a worse bug than the spirits, because these units had a target,
were in MOVING state, and stepped their full 75 millitiles every single tick. They covered
0.08 tiles in six seconds.

`_avoid_buildings` recomputed which way to go round an obstacle on every tick. A unit
directly behind a building has both perpendiculars exactly sideways to where it wants to
go, so both dot products are zero, the tie-break picks one, the unit shifts a little, the
sign flips, and it shifts back. Holding the chosen side until the building is cleared takes
that skeleton from 0.08 tiles to 11.08.

Across eight matches, units idle more than five seconds went from 344 to 51, and every one
of the 51 was legitimately standing still to attack. Excluding attackers leaves three, in
eight matches.

The reason no test caught it is worth writing down. Every stuck-unit check asks "did it
move", and this unit moved constantly. The freeze was in *displacement*, not in speed, and
nothing was measuring displacement. The viewer was measuring it, because that is what
watching something is.

One test I wrote and deleted: that a crowd splits around a building rather than queueing on
one side. They all go the same way, and that is correct - they follow one flow field, and a
queue rounding a tower on the same side is what the real game shows. I had asserted a
behaviour I invented rather than one I had checked.

**Units were freezing a stride past the bridge, and the viewer is what found it.** Reported
as "theyre getting stuck" with a screenshot. A sweep for "alive, no target, has not moved in
six seconds" found 55 such observations across twelve matches, every single one a Fire
Spirit.

An ordering bug. The movement fallback - the nearest enemy building, which is what makes a
Hog Rider walk at a tower rather than stand still - is chosen *inside* the candidate loop,
after `is_valid_target` has already rejected the candidate. The spirits carry
`cannot_target_towers`, so every tower is thrown out before the fallback can see it, so
`target_uid` ends up None, and `_move` reads `target_uid` for its destination. The unit
stops where it stands and never moves again.

The rule itself is right - a spirit cannot connect to a crown tower on its own - but it is
about connecting, not pathing. The fix is a separate `walk_target_uid` that only `_move`
reads, so `target_uid` stays None and `_attack` still refuses. Both halves are pinned,
because a fix that let spirits chip towers would be worse than the freeze: a spirit now
walks 8.8 tiles at a tower and deals it exactly zero.

Worth noting how this surfaced. Fourteen hundred tests, several sweeps written specifically
to catch inert cards, and none of them caught a unit that deploys, walks, and then stops -
because every one of them measures whether something *happened*, not whether it kept
happening. Two seconds of watching did it.

**The bridges were the wrong width, and decompiling was never going to tell us.**
`libg.so` is 28MB, stripped, x86-64, and packed: its 8,373 strings are 8-character noise
like `NPdh9Hrs`, and base.apk ships an encrypted `libg.so.text.ecc` decrypted at runtime.
`libsupercell_clashroyale.so` is a JNI shim with nothing but libc symbols. Getting the
collision solver out of that is defeating a commercial packer and then reversing 28MB of
stripped C++ - weeks, not an afternoon, and the collision *inputs* we would want
(CollisionRadius, Mass) are already in the CSVs we read.

Arena geometry is not in the shipped data either - `arenas.csv` is trophy and progression
metadata, because the playfield is identical in every arena and so lives in the engine.

But it is published, and checking it against ours took one search and found a real error.
Bridges are two tiles wide in Arenas 1-6 and 8-9 and **three** tiles wide in Arena 7 and
Arenas 10-23 - which is every arena this project cares about, Path of Legends included. The
simulator modelled the narrow bridge. That funnels a push harder than the real board does,
and it matters most for exactly the bridge-spam decks the new opponent pool is full of.

Board size checked out at 18x32. The lesson is the cheap one: the answer was a published
fact and a search, not a disassembler.

**Rooting the emulator revealed a live patch layer, and it is five files.** Supercell ships
the APK's `csv_logic` as a base and patches content on top into
`/data/data/<pkg>/update/`, which is what the running client actually plays with. An
extraction from the APK alone is the game as it shipped, not the game as it is.

The delta today: four spirit files whose hitpoints went 85 to 84, plus a localisation
patch. That is the whole thing. `extract_game_data.py` now overlays that layer
automatically (`--skip-live-patch` to opt out), and reports which files differ, so the
answer stops being a guess. `adb root` is enough on MuMu - no `su` binary needed.

It also settles the spirits. Three sources disagreed: the live client's base of 84 scales
to about 212, Supercell's own August balance post says 215, and RoyaleAPI's table says 230.
The simulator carries 215 from the balance post, so **RoyaleAPI is the stale one and the
simulator was right** - which is worth knowing, because a chunk of the fourteen cards the
level audit flags as ">5% divergent" are probably the same story.

Two corrections I owed on the way here. Rune Giant and Spirit Empress were reported as
"missing from the extracted client data" and neither was: Rune Giant ships as
`GiantBuffer`, Spirit Empress as `MergeMaiden` with a 3-elixir foot row and a 6-elixir
mounted one. I had already learned that published names hide behind codenames when I found
the first, then told the user to update their game rather than applying it to the second -
on a card released in July 2025, a year before the APK I claimed was too old. Checking the
release date took one search, after the wrong conclusion had already been handed over.

**The opponent plays 204 real ladder decks now, and nine cards were being hidden by a
stale list.** `train_ppo.py` names the core problem itself: the mirror defends exactly as
well as we attack, so every sweep has answered "does this beat a copy of me".

Most of the fix was already here. `ScriptedOpponent` pilots any deck with style-driven
heuristics, and `classify_style` was written explicitly "for decks imported from
elsewhere". What was missing was decks - the pool held five hand-written archetypes its own
docstring admitted were "archetypes rather than a live meta snapshot".

`scripts/sync_meta_decks.py` reads 1.45 million real Path of Legends battles from a public
MIT-licensed dataset, counts which eight-card combinations actually get played, and keeps
the top 200 plus whatever is needed so every playable card appears somewhere. RoyaleAPI's
own popular-decks page returns 403 to automated access and is not scraped. 236,944 distinct
ladder decks were seen; the single most-played one is 2.6 Hog Cycle, which is our deck.

The find along the way is bigger than the plumbing. Resolving log card names exposed that
**Ronin appears in roughly a tenth of ladder decks and the simulator would not play it** -
along with Vines, Boss Bandit, Berserker, Goblin Demolisher, Suspicious Bush, Goblin Curse,
Little Prince and Goblinstein. All nine are in the client data, all nine already worked,
and all nine were excluded because `playable_public_cards` gated on RoyaleAPI's catalogue,
which carries 120 cards and none of the 2026 additions. The upstream mirror is stale, not
our copy of it.

So a card now qualifies as public either by being in the snapshot or by having been observed
in real ladder play, which is the stronger evidence. The pool went 119 to 129, and
`test_cards_do_something` covers the new ten automatically - that is what makes reopening
the gate safe rather than reckless.

Three tests failed on the change and all three were right to: the pool is no longer a
subset of the snapshot, the count is no longer 119, and nine of the reopened cards have no
artwork in either vendored set. The last one is recorded as a named exemption rather than
hidden, because it is cosmetic and the viewer will draw them blank.

**End-to-end after all of it: 2501 card plays, zero errors, 20-20.** Forty random-deck
matches drawn from the full playable pool, both sides playing a random affordable card
every second. No exceptions, matches resolving between 2203 and 6000 ticks rather than all
timing out, and the seat split exactly even.

The even split is worth stating: it re-confirms under random play what an earlier run
concluded from the other direction, that the seat bias lives in `BrainPolicy` and not in
the board.

A first attempt at this soak reported sixty matches, zero errors and sixty draws at exactly
6000 ticks, which looked like a clean pass. Nothing was ever played - `Match.step()` alone
has no policy behind it - so it proved only that the engine does not crash while idle. A
sweep that quietly tests nothing is the recurring hazard in this project and it does not
stop being one just because the sweep is mine.

**A cursed Golem left two Golemites and a goblin.** Goblin Curse converts whatever dies
inside it, and some units are declared exempt - every one of them a unit whose death
already leaves something of its own: Golem, Lava Hound, Battle Ram, Elixir Golem, Cannon
Cart, Skeleton Balloon, Suspicious Bush. `IgnoreBuff` carries that and nothing read it, so
the curse was collecting free value from exactly the cards designed to deny it.

Two things I got wrong on the way, both caught by writing the test:

  * Goblin Giant looked exempt because his file contains the immunity. It belongs to
    `[CHARACTER.SpearGoblinGiant]`, the goblins he leaves - so he converts and they do not,
    which is what the simulator already did. Reading a field means reading which section
    owns it.
  * A single immunity is written as a bare string rather than a list, and iterating a
    string yields characters. Royal Delivery came out immune to "E", "v", "e", "n", "t"...

**A hardcoded number never stops working, which is the problem with it.** The sweep
flagged `SubActionsDelay` as unread. That is true and mostly harmless - almost every action
group in the client is `[0, 0]` or a sub-tick 50ms - but it led somewhere: Evolved Zap's
two pulses were transcribed into the loader by hand as `((0, 2500, 100), (1450, 3000, 100))`
with a comment saying what the graph was at the time.

They are still right. `Zap_EV1_AfterStun_V2` stages its damage spawn at 1450ms, and
`Zap_EV1_SpawnAOE_medium` declares `Radius = ["+", 500]` against Zap's 2500. But nothing
was checking, and a transcription that has drifted looks exactly like one that has not. It
is now re-derived from the graph on every run, along with an assertion that the older
wider `Zap_EV1_SpawnAOE_large` is still orphaned rather than quietly wired back in.

I also guessed at how many action groups stage by a real interval, wrote four into a test,
and got twenty-five. The list is now the measured one, with the honest caveat attached:
being on it means a file stages something, not that the staging is modelled. Most of it is
animation.

**The documented throughput does not reproduce, and the new mechanics are not why.** All
this run's additions are per-tick loops - area attraction, drill relocation, ability
summons, paratroopers, boomerang axes - so it was worth checking what they cost. Measured
365 environment steps a second against a documented 504, which looks like a 28% regression.

It is not. Running the same script against the commit before this run's work gives 360, and
current HEAD gives 365. The mechanics cost nothing detectable; the 504 was either a
different machine state or a different measurement, and it has been corrected in the
handoff rather than left to be trusted.

Worth noting as a method point: the instinct on seeing 365-against-504 is to go optimising.
Checking the old commit first took two minutes and would have saved an afternoon.

**The last unresolved action node in the client was a Monk interaction.** Firecracker's
projectile declares `ActionOnDeflector` - an `ActionDealDamage` of 25 aimed at whoever
sends the shot back - so deflecting her fireworks costs the Monk something rather than
being free. It sat in the audit as an "unresolved champion / hero source graph" attached to
Firecracker, which is why it was never obvious that it belonged to a different card's
mechanic entirely.

`sim.readiness` now has one fewer blocker. The remaining two are the eight calibration
gates and the live probe matrix, and the gate message has been reworded - not the bar. It
used to read as eight unimplemented cards, which was true when it was written. All eight
now work with one named approximation each, and the report says so.

**A frozen Tombstone kept making skeletons.** Freeze on a defensive spawner is a standard
play and it was buying only the attack pause - the hut produced at exactly its normal rate
throughout.

`SpawnSpeedMultiplier` is declared on twelve buffs and was read by nothing. What made the
fix one line rather than a new field is that the client sets it to exactly the same number
as `HitSpeedMultiplier` in every single case: -100 for Stun and the freezes, 130 to 170 for
the rages, 100 for IgnoreBarrel. So the field already carried on every buffed entity is the
field the client uses, and `_tick_spawners` simply never looked at it. Rage now speeds a hut
up for the same reason, which it also never did.

A frozen hut holds its wave rather than losing it, so it resumes where it was on thaw
instead of restarting the timer - the difference between Freeze delaying a wave and
cancelling one.

**Reading the field beat reasoning about the data.** Monk's spell reflection was built by
inference: a spell with a projectile speed is thrown, minus Lightning for declaring
`ProjectileStartHeight`, minus Royal Delivery named by hand. That reproduced the published
list, passed nineteen tests, and was wrong.

`DeflectBehaviour` was sitting unread on 33 projectiles the whole time - found by the same
sweep that found the attraction. It says outright what Monk can catch and what happens to
each: `NoDeflect` on 23 of them, `InvertDirection` on the Logs, `CheckOnlyTargetPosition`
on Arrows. So:

  * The Log *is* caught, and reverses rather than being redirected - the inference had
    dropped it entirely. Roll direction is derived from the owning side, so flipping
    ownership reverses it exactly as the client describes.
  * Lightning and Royal Delivery say `NoDeflect` outright, which is better evidence than
    the height field and the hand-written exception that were standing in for it.
  * Arrows are checked against the aim point rather than the blast, which is the mechanic
    behind the wiki's note that they only fully reflect from near the centre.

It also fixed something older. Monk was reflecting *troop* shots that declare `NoDeflect` -
Princess, Electro Dragon, Mega Knight, the spirits, seventeen cards - because the engine's
projectile reflection never checked. He had a mechanic the client denies him.

One embarrassment worth recording: an earlier probe of this reported The Log being
reflected, when the playable card is `log` and `the_log` is a spell-table alias with no
card behind it. `play_card` refused it silently and the probe read the resulting nothing as
success. The test caught it because it asserts its own setup - which is the same lesson as
the three harness bugs in test_cards_do_something.

**No champion or hero ability is inert any more.** The last one, Super Hog Rider Terry,
failed for a reason none of the others did: `SuperHogJump` is declared *only* in
`character_abilities.csv` and in no TOML at all, and the ability loader read TOML. Exactly
two abilities are CSV-only - that one and Monk's party-mode MegaDeflect - so both cards
were holding an ability the loader could not see.

Wiring the CSV exposed a second, smaller thing. The gate then offered the ability and the
scheduler refused it, because a dash needs a count and Super Hog's declares only a
`DashRange`. Golden Knight chains his and says how many; a single leap says nothing, and
zero read as "no dash" rather than "one".

`tests/test_ability_coverage.py` now has an empty `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`. That makes its strict
xfail parametrise over nothing and pytest skips it, which reads identically whether every
ability works or somebody deleted the list - so there is now a test asserting the list is
empty, rather than leaving the achievement as a silent skip.

One decision recorded rather than taken: `SuperHogJump` carries `Cooldown = 7000`, making
it the only ability besides MegaDeflect with a non-blank one, and therefore the one place
the August 2026 single-use rule might not apply. It is a party card and those notes speak
about ladder Heroes and Champions, so applying the 7000 would be stretching the source. It
stays single-use, pinned, until a party-mode reference says otherwise.

**Every calibration gate is now a detail rather than a mechanic.** Balloon Hero was the
last one that read like it genuinely needed a recording - "logX10000 accelerated payload
trajectory and interception timing". Two elixir bought an animation: the loader never
followed an `ActionSpawn` of `ProjectileType` into the character its projectile carries, so
`SpawnCharacter = "SkeletonTrooper"` went unread and the activation simply returned.

The trajectory is a formula. The speed ramps by +2 every 150ms and is overridden to
`logX10000(max(5, rampup - 1)) / 80`; integrating it gives the dive time. The only real
unknown is which logarithm `logX10000` denotes - natural log lands him in 0.9 to 1.5
seconds across the ability's range, which is exactly the published "after a 1-second
delay", where base ten would take 1.5 to 2.7. That moves when he lands, never where.

Everything else was in the file and the published description agreed with all of it: the
6500 circle, closest ground target with ties on highest current hitpoints, the fallback
landing under the balloon when nothing is in range, and the `StartPositionZOffset = 1000`
that makes even that straight-down landing a fall. His landing burst needed nothing at all
- it started working the moment `SpawnAreaObject` was read for the Goblin Drill.

All eight gated cards now work. Each still carries one approximation, and the audit now
names that approximation instead of the mechanic: a strong-band boundary, a hit ordering, a
tower proximity threshold, a flight curve, a return-leg travel time, a field placement
against a moving target, a climb arc, and this logarithm. That is a different kind of list
from the one this run started with.

**Evolved Princess was never firing her ice arrow.** Her evolution *is* the slow field,
and she fired her ordinary arrow every time - so the evolution was a Princess with a
slightly larger splash on paper and nothing else, with every stat on the card correct.

The field is declared on attack sequence index 1: three tiles, 5500ms, `IceWizardSlowDown`
at -30% move and hit speed. One number is not shipped at all - the cadence lives in
`attack_count % Princess_EV1_reload_frequency == 0`, and that variable is an empty
`[VARIABLE]` section with no value anywhere in the client. The published "every third
attack, starting with the first" fills it, recorded in combat_rules.json with its source
rather than guessed inline.

The trap here was the second area. Her death freeze is a *different* 3.5-second field that
carries 66 damage, and it was already modelled; the arrow's field blanks its own
`SpawnAreaEffectObject` and carries none. Reading the two as one would have handed her free
damage on every third shot, and it would have looked like a working implementation.

**Elite Archer Hero: offered, then refused.** Harder than Skeleton King, whose ability the
gate never offered at all. This one passed the capability check on its 100ms buff and then
failed to schedule, so two elixir bought nothing - it looked like it worked right up to the
point where it did not.

Three effects, each behind a different indirection. The decoy is an
`ActionSpawnToLocation` and the loader knew only the `ActionSpawnGuard` shape. Its
seven-second life is an `ActionInterval` into an `ActionKill` rather than a `LifeTime`
field, so an unfixed decoy would have stood on the board forever - a much better card than
the real one. And the three arrows hang off the *projectile* of attack sequence index 1
rather than off the ability, while the attack sequence itself lives on the CHARACTER row
and does not survive the EXT overlay that defines the hero. Walking the ability graph finds
none of it; the parallel action has to be found by scanning his projectile tables, which is
safe only because exactly one card in the client declares one.

He had also quietly lost the trait that defines Magic Archer. `pierces` is recorded per
card name in combat_rules.json rather than read from the client, the hero form had no
entry, and his arrows stopped at the first enemy while firing the identical
`EliteArcherArrow`.

That leaves two inert abilities: `balloon_hero`, genuinely a curve nobody has stated, and
`super_hog_rider_terry`, an event card that also happens to be the one ability in the
client with a non-blank Cooldown.

**Four cards fixed from the user telling me how they work.** The calibration gates were
never all measurement problems - several were "nobody has said what this does". Being told
in three sentences unblocked three of them, and each turned out to be mostly declared once
I knew what to look for.

*Executioner's axe comes back.* Both he and his evolution throw a boomerang, and the
simulator threw it at whatever he was aiming at, dealt damage once, and stopped. A card
whose job is clearing a line was a single-target hit, and anything standing behind the
target took nothing. His own card screen says "70 x2" (`OverrideIntValue2 = 2`,
`Unit = "INTEGER_TIMES_X"`) and seven tiles out and back at 9166 mt/s comes to 1527ms
against a declared `PingpongVisualTime = 1500` - two independently derived numbers agreeing,
which is the only reason this was buildable without a recording.

*Goblin Drill surfaced in silence.* It declares `SpawnAreaObject = "GoblinDrillDamage"` and
the loader only ever read the *indirect* form of that declaration, where an area names the
action that spawns a character. Worse, a burrower is two rows - the digging form the card
places and the building it becomes via `SpawnPathfindMorph` - and the damage is on the
second while the simulator instantiates the first. Fixing the direct form also caught
Electro Wizard and Ice Wizard, whose deploy shocks declare `CrownTowerDamagePercent = -100`
and were handing out free crown-tower damage on a very routine play.

*The Evolved Drill relocates.* Thresholds, hide time and the goblins left behind are all on
`ActionGoblinDrillEvoRelocate`; only the destination was missing, and the published
behaviour has it - same spot, unless it is hugging a crown tower, in which case a quarter
turn around it.

*Monk reflects spells.* Projectile reflection existed; spells ignored him completely, so a
Fireball on a meditating Monk hit him for full and the caster kept their tower. Which
spells is decided by the data - a spell with a projectile speed is thrown - and that
reproduces the published reflectable list exactly, once Lightning is excluded by the
`ProjectileStartHeight` only it declares. That field was not on the spell loader's key
allow-list, the same allow-list that once gave Fireball a 0.7-tile blast.

The one that nearly went wrong: reflection changes *whose* spell it is, not just where it
lands. Moving only the impact point sent the Fireball to the caster's tower and still had
it damage the Monk's side, so it did nothing at all and looked like it worked.

**Three more abilities are inert, and now they are written down.** Having found one
champion whose ability the activation gate refused, the obvious next question was how many
others. `tests/test_ability_coverage.py` asks it directly: put every champion and hero
down, put an enemy in front of it, hand it unlimited elixir, and check the ability is both
offered and accepted. Twenty-one cards, four failures, one of them a false positive - Mega
Minion Hero correctly refuses a warp when there is nothing to warp onto, which an empty
arena reports as broken.

The three real ones are pinned as strict xfails with what each actually needs:

  * `elite_archer_hero` - offered and then refused. Entirely declared and simply not
    written: 100ms of invisibility, a decoy left where he stood for seven seconds, and a
    triple shot for the same seven seconds at Damage 19 with two extra projectiles 1500
    apart. The action audit called this "teleport/dummy placement plus triple
    line-projectile collision" as though it needed measuring; only the pierce ordering
    does, and the gate now says so.
  * `balloon_hero` - the `logX10000` payload curve, genuinely a calibration question.
  * `super_hog_rider_terry` - an event card, and the one ability in the client with a
    non-blank Cooldown (7000), so also the one place the single-use rule may not hold.

Strict, so implementing any of them fails the test until the entry is removed. The list
cannot quietly grow and cannot quietly go stale.

**Skeleton King's ability did not exist.** Found by asking a different question:
rather than working through the audit's gate list, sweep for client keys that appear
nowhere in `sim/` at all (`scripts/unread_fields.py`). That is what turned up
`AttractPercentage`, and following the same thread turned up this.

His ability is his card - two elixir on a four-elixir body, raising six to sixteen
skeletons - and `can_activate_ability` refused him outright. The loader looked for a
buff, a dash or a guard, found an `AreaEffectObject` it had no handling for, and left
every field blank, so the gate saw a champion with no declared effect. He stood there
being a mediocre four-elixir troop and every one of his stats was correct.

All of it was declared: `ResurrectBaseCount = 6`, `SpawnLimit = 16`, and a graveyard
saying one skeleton every 250ms between 2.5 and 3.5 tiles out. The published description
agrees exactly - six at no souls, sixteen at ten, one at a time in a ring. The staggering
matters and is now modelled: a swarm arriving over four seconds can be answered
mid-summon, one that appears at once cannot.

**A mechanic that looked missing and was not.** The same sweep raised the question of why
`ability_cooldown_ms` exists, is stored, sets `ability_ready_at_ms`, and is zero for every
champion but one - so a champion uses its ability once per lifetime, ever. That reads like
half a mechanic, and the wiki has cooldowns for all of them: Archer Queen 17s, Monk 17s,
Skeleton King 20s, Golden Knight 8s, Little Prince 30s.

The fix was written. Then checking the source found the August 2026 balance changes
(Season 86): Hero and Champion abilities became single-use, "from all abilities except
Boss Bandit", affecting 8 of 14 Heroes and 7 of 8 Champions. The simulator was already
right, the wiki numbers are all pre-August, and the one-line recharge silently gave Boss
Bandit unlimited Getaway Grenades - she has two charges three seconds apart, not a
refilling one.

It is pinned in tests/test_ability_charges.py with the citation, because the next person
to read that field will reach for the same fix. Being able to tell a missing mechanic from
a deliberately removed one needs the source, not the code.

**Tornado did not move anything, and it had never moved anything.**

Chasing the Wizard Hero gate led into the tornado its ability spawns, and from
there to the discovery that the engine had no attraction of any kind. Tornado -
a card whose every use is repositioning, pulling a Hog off the tower, stacking a
swarm for a Fireball, dragging troops onto the king to activate it - was
modelled as one second of 60 damage a second, which is less than an Arrow. The
damage numbers were right, so the whole suite stayed green.

The number was in the file: `[BUFF.Tornado]` declares `AttractPercentage = 360`,
and reading it as a pull speed in percent of one tile per second gives 3.6
tiles/sec against the wiki's independently-stated "up to 3.5 tiles per second".
The gap is the resistance the wiki also documents - a unit walking away keeps
walking, so its own movement eats into the drag - and that falls out for free
from applying the pull as a displacement alongside normal movement rather than
overriding it. Measured: a stationary Giant is dragged 3.6 tiles, a charging Hog
0.7.

Exactly three things in the client declare the field, and all three were inert:

  * Tornado, 360 - the spell
  * Evolved Valkyrie, 300 - *her entire evolution*. "Evolved Valkyrie draws all
    enemies towards her with each swing" is the published description of the
    card. She swung, and nothing moved. Her damage was correct, so nothing
    failed. Her tornado is also declared `HitsAir` while her axe is ground-only,
    which is why the pull is spawned as a real area instead of going through the
    inline attack-area path that skips flying units outright.
  * Wizard Hero, 250 - a mini tornado beside the ability projectile's damage
    area, landing on the struck unit and dragging its neighbours in. Its buff is
    declared inside wizard_hero.toml rather than in the shared tables, so it
    needed looking for in both places.

Three cards, one of them a meta staple and one of them an evolution defined by
the mechanic, all silently doing nothing. This is the same failure mode as the
twenty-five inert shooters: not a wrong number, a mechanic that was never wired,
where every number around it checks out.

**A "needs a live probe" gate turned out to be an unparsed section.** The action audit
listed Mega Minion Hero as "accelerating warp path, arrival contact and target acquisition",
which sounds like three things needing video. All three are in the shipped file:
`ActionWarpCharacter` with Speed 1500, and a `TARGET_RESOLVER` declaring
`RESOLVER_STRATEGY_LOWEST_MAX_HP` then `RESOLVER_STRATEGY_FURTHEST_TARGET` over a Global
shape with towers filtered out. Warp onto the frailest thing on the board, ties broken by
distance, anywhere in the arena.

The reason the target half looked unknowable is that the loader never parsed
`TARGET_RESOLVER` sections at all - it read the speed and had nowhere to get the
destination. Attaching that table made the ability implementable in an afternoon, the same
way charge was: the numbers were sitting unused and the work was one function that read
them. What is genuinely still open is the flight *shape* - `Acceleration = 400` is a curve
and the engine arrives after distance/speed, which changes when it lands rather than where.

That is two gates now that were mislabelled rather than unmeasured, after Executioner Evo.
It is worth checking the file before believing the audit.

**Every playable card now provably changes the battle.** The damage chain kept having one
more hop in it. After Princess (decorative projectile in `Projectile`, the real one in
`CustomFirstProjectile`) and Firecracker (damage on the projectile its projectile spawns)
came Evolved Princess, which blanks `CustomFirstProjectile` at the top level and names the
real one inside its `AttackSequenceList`; and Evolved Executioner, whose axe row says
Damage 0 and points `OnStartingAction` at a controller holding Damage 70 / StrongDamage 94.
Both were dealing nothing. The loader follows the whole declared chain now.

One card is left and stays left: Super Archers has no damage in any source - not the
character row, not `SuperArcherChargeArrow`, not the area effect that projectile spawns
(which is a pull), and not RoyaleAPI, which publishes its hitpoints per level and no damage
at all. It is named in `tests/test_ranged_damage.py` rather than given a number.

The sweep that found the last two now covers everything: `tests/test_cards_do_something.py`
plays all 119 public cards and asserts each one moves damage, spawns something, creates an
area, or shifts hitpoints. Writing it took three attempts and every failure looked exactly
like an engine bug - spells cast into our own half where there is nothing to hit, the enemy
unit placed at a coordinate that mirrors into our half so `play_card` correctly refused, and
the enemy unit never in the enemy's hand. It reported thirteen broken spells, then twelve,
then ninety-nine broken cards. All three were the harness. The test asserts its own setup
now, because a sweep that quietly tests nothing is worse than no sweep: it reads as evidence.

**Twenty-five shooters dealt no damage, and the fix came from being argued with.** The
engine held non-homing shots back from resolving "until a measured collision rule is
available". That reads as caution and is not: Princess, Bomber, Mortar, Firecracker,
Hunter, Bowler, Elite Archer and eighteen others fired and hurt nothing at all. The user
pointed out that in Clash Royale a shot which has left an attacker connects, and the data
agrees - `check_collisions` is false on those projectiles. Two more had zero damage even
after that, because Princess names a *decorative* projectile in `Projectile` and carries
the real one in `CustomFirstProjectile`, while Firecracker's damage is on the projectile
its projectile spawns; the loader stopped at the first hop and now follows the chain.

**The project was syncing one file out of thirty-seven.** `cards.json` carries identity
and elixir and nothing else. The same source publishes per-level hitpoint and damage
tables, every projectile's speed and homing flag, and every spell's radius. Several things
sitting on the "needs a controlled capture" list were simply unfetched. That list went
from 19 clips to 10, and the readiness gate from five required probe categories to three -
demanding video for a number that ships in a file, while accepting the same source for
every override in `combat_rules.json`, was never consistent.

A wrong turn worth recording. The per-level tables made it look like `scale_stat` ignored
`RelativeLevel`: every rarity shares one multiplier sequence and differs only in where it
starts, and subtracting the offset reproduced the published value exactly for Prince Buff
and Super Hog Rider. Applied it; mismatches went from 24 to 63. The client stores most
bases at unified level 1 while the published tables start at the rarity's level 1, so
`level - 1` is right for the client's convention. Nine cards do store their base at the
rarity's own level, and those are corrected individually through `combat_rules.json`. The
audit caught the bad fix within a minute, which is the argument for having built it.

**The towers were four numbers that match no level.** They were read off a live account
because the tower curve was not in the shipped files - it is published after all, and
princess 3346 falls between levels 10 and 11, king 5735 between 5592 and 6144. `sim/towers.py`
derives them and models the tower troops, which are not reskins: Dagger Duchess fires every
500ms against 800ms, Cannoneer every 2200ms for 320. Two familiar traps on the way in -
`chef_tower.toml` holds the cook at 5 hitpoints and the tower at 1240, and a troop's damage
lives on its projectile rather than its tower block.

**Throughput is not the constraint, and it is worth knowing that before optimising.** The
RL environment runs 504 steps a second in one process, about 373 steps to an episode, so
ten million steps is around 5.5 hours single-process or under an hour across eight
workers. What stands between here and a trained agent is fidelity, not compute.

`python -m sim.probe_plan` now prints the 19 controlled clips still needed, each paired
with the number the engine currently predicts, so a recording lands as agreement or
disagreement rather than a judgement call. `sim/watch.py --skin game` dresses the board
like the real arena and draws non-homing shots along the path they were launched on,
which puts the largest remaining gap on screen instead of in an audit.

## 2026-08-21 - blocks 111/112, the enemy tower reader never once said "full"

Took over as lead; the previous claude had been quiet for 3503 minutes. That number is
not a stalled agent, it is a stalled machine: `supervisor.log` jumps straight from
`block 108 applied by gemini_pro` at 2026-08-18 16:02 to `SUPERVISOR start block=109` at
2026-08-21 00:06, and `watchdog.log` has no entries in between either. The watchdog is a
Scheduled Task every 5 minutes, so 660 consecutive firings did not happen - the host was
off or asleep for 56 hours. Nothing in the loop failed and nothing needed restarting; it
had already come back on its own and played four matches before I arrived. Worth saying
plainly because the captain's "silent for N minutes" reads as an agent problem and this
one was not.

A thing I briefly got wrong, recorded so the next agent does not spend the same ten
minutes: `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` lists two supervisors, two cr_bots and two
captains, which looks exactly like the duplicate-agent disaster the block-92 addendum
warns about. It is not. `ParentProcessId` shows each venv `python.exe` shim spawning the
base Python312 interpreter as its child. Check parentage before believing the count.

### Scoreboard

| block | record | crowns | hog share | cards/match |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 105 | 3W 1L 1D | 8 for / 6 against | 16.4% | 53.8 |
| 107 | 1W 4L 0D | 3 for / 6 against | 12.4% | 33.8 |
| 108 | 2W 2L 1D | 7 for / 7 against | 15.9% | 37.8 |
| 111 | 1W 2L 2D | 6 for / 7 against | 14.0% | 35.8 |

Items 2 and 3 are fine and have been for a while. Item 1 is flat at about break-even.

### The card mix is legal, and three shifts have now chased it as if it were not

The block-101 entry called the mix "arithmetically impossible" - three cheap cards taking
54% of plays in a deck that cycles strictly - and fixed a real duplicate-slot bug on the
strength of it. That fix landed and works. But the mix did not move (skeletons 18.6%,
ice_spirit 18.3%, fireball 5.2% over the last 442 plays), and the reason is that the
premise was wrong.

I checked it directly rather than re-reasoning about it. For each of the last ten matches,
walk the action list and confirm no card reappears until four *distinct* others have been
played, which is what an eight-card cycle forces. **442 plays, zero violations.** And
`HandTracker` is per-slot vision voting with no deck model anywhere in it, so nothing is
enforcing that by construction - it is an independent check, and it passes.

Strict cycling equalises play counts only if you play every card that reaches your hand.
Hold one, and the other three slots rotate through the remaining seven while the held card
sits there. Holding two produces exactly the observed shape. So the mix is not a perception
artefact, it is the bot holding Musketeer and Fireball - which the 2.6 guides actually
endorse for Musketeer ("your only effective support card, so you must save it for defence
almost always"). It is still on the low side at 5.4%, but it is a policy question, not a
broken instrument. **Stop reading the card mix as evidence of misperception.**

### The enemy tower reader has been ~12% low since it was "fixed"

`_measure_side_hp` snaps anything at or above 0.95 to a full 1.000. Both princess towers
are full at the start of every match. So across 13384 logged readings the ally reader says
exactly 1.000 in 3986 of them, which is what a working reader looks like.

The enemy reader says 1.000 **seven times.** Not seven matches - seven readings. Instead it
piles up at 0.91 (1068), 0.89 (431) and 0.87 (467), and nine of the last twelve matches
open with an enemy reading of `0.89/0.91` at t=2-15s, before damage is possible.

The earlier entry above found `ENEMY_BAR_FULL_WIDTH` at 161, corrected it to 133 against
printed hitpoint numbers, and recorded that the ally width of 119 "over-reads by about
0.07. The two bars are simply not the same width." That correction was real and large. It
was also not finished, and I could not reconcile 133 with a full bar reading 0.887 until I
segmented a live frame across x:

    206-215   gold, the tower's frame trim
    216-333   pink, the fill
    334-335   dark red, a two-pixel border closing the element
    336-386   flat arena background, no further structure

The bar element is 216-335. That is 119 - the ally width after all. The two measurements
were of two different things: 133 is the outer trim, 119 is the fill track, and
`_measure_side_hp` scans the fill track from x=216. A full 118px fill over 133 is 0.887,
which slips under the 0.95 snap and is why a full enemy tower could never read full.

**What this cost.** Not crowns directly - a destroyed tower measures a zero-length run, and
zero over either width is zero. The damage is in the learning loop. `experience.py` builds
its reward from enemy tower damage dealt minus ally tower damage taken, the ally half was
correct, and the enemy half was 12% low. Every episode since has paid the bot slightly less
for attacking than for defending. This project has fought turtling three separate times and
tuned `defend_min_threat`, `emergency_depth` and `cycle_to_hog_elixir` against it; a
systematic 12% thumb on the scale toward defence was sitting underneath all of it.

### A lone Skeleton was an emergency

`_emergency` asked only how deep a unit was, never how dangerous. One Skeleton that walked
to the tower scores 1.175 and opened the door that bypasses `serious` for the whole defence
block *and* arms the last-resort branch. Live: 8 of 26 `defend_fallback_*` plays across ten
matches answered a threat scoring 1, spending an Ice Golem or Skeletons on a unit the tower
kills for free. Block 111 ran 18 fallback plays, up from 16.

`threat_score` already multiplies by depth, which spreads the cases wide enough to separate
cleanly: a lone Skeleton at the tower scores 1.18, a lone Mini P.E.K.K.A. at the same depth
4.6, a Miner 6.9. A floor of 3 keeps every real one. The existing
`test_defends_lone_mini_pekka_at_tower_with_skeletons` is the lower bound and still passes.

### Changed (2)

1. `scripts/tower_hp.py` - `ENEMY_BAR_FULL_WIDTH` 133 -> 119, with the segmentation above
   recorded in the comment so the next person does not have to re-derive which element 133
   measured.
2. `scripts/brain/policy.py` + `config.json` - new `emergency_min_threat`, default 3.0,
   bounded [2.0, 5.0] in `bounds.json`.

I stopped at two. The obvious third was `cycle_to_hog_elixir` 3.5 -> 6.0, and I had built
a case for it from the elixir column in the logs: 72% of plays happen at 4 elixir or less,
which starves Musketeer and Fireball at 4 each. **Do not make this change.** The entry
above ("Live evidence overruling a very strong simulator result") already tried it and
reverted it with the reason spelled out: the simulator's 400-match sweep loves a high
threshold (3.5 -> 31.8% win, 9.0 -> 62.5%) because nothing in the simulator punishes
passivity, and live it built a mid-elixir dead zone where the idle floor did 29% of plays
and Hog share fell to 5%. Cycling rate belongs to `cycle_min_gap_seconds`, which is already
at 4.0. Reading that entry saved me from re-running a known regression, which is the
argument for reading the journal before touching config.

### Tests

98 pass (`test_brain.py`, `test_device_scaling.py`, `test_defensive_micro.py`), verified
against a clean detached worktree of the commit rather than my working tree, per the
block-92 addendum - the brain reads `learned.json`, which the live bot rewrites underneath
you, so a green working tree proves nothing about what you committed.

Two tests added, both checked to fail on the old code rather than on a stub mismatch. The
lone-Skeleton test reproduces the production symptom exactly: without the floor it returns
`defend_stall_ice_spirit` at `threat: 1.175`.

`test_enemy_bar_width_matches_the_measured_screen_width` pinned 133 and had to change. I
did not simply flip the number - a test whose whole purpose is stopping a guess creeping
back in should not be editable by whoever guesses next. It now asserts the property that
actually broke, that a bar filled to the full track width reads 1.000, in both arena
colourings.

### A note on who committed this

All five files landed in `32a1647 "block 111 review by gemini_pro"`, and the
`101598a "pre-review snapshot block 111"` before it swept up my half-finished
`tower_hp.py`. I did not make either commit. The content is exactly mine and gemini_pro
changed nothing of its own this round, so nothing was lost or mangled this time - but this
is the same race the block-92 addendum describes, and it is still live. Check
`git log --oneline -5` for commits you did not make, and diff before you trust the tree.

### For the next agent

1. **Block 112 is the first block under the corrected tower reader, and the enemy half of
   every earlier number is not comparable to it.** Enemy tower fractions will read about
   12% higher for the same real hitpoints. Crowns are unaffected and remain comparable.
2. **Watch whether the learning loop drifts toward offence over the next few blocks.** That
   is the prediction the tower fix makes: `learned.json` has been under-paying attack by
   12% for every episode it holds. If Hog share and `push_*` tags rise on their own, that
   is the fix landing and it should not be tuned against.
3. **`fireball_finish_hp` is 0.052 and was set while enemy towers read 12% low.** It now
   means what it says. Anything else calibrated against an enemy tower fraction deserves
   the same look - `hog_inbound_tower_fraction` (0.06) is the other one.
4. **The ally reader has a zero-glitch worth chasing.** My probe frame read ally left as
   0.00 mid-match with the tower alive; `test_tower_hp_glitch_is_filtered_out` exists
   because this is known, but the filter treats a symptom. The enemy bug above was found by
   asking "what should this read when the answer is certain, and does it" - the same
   question applied to the ally reader is one screenshot.
5. **Musketeer at 5.4% is now a real, open policy question rather than a perception bug.**
   The guides say hold it for defence, so it should be low; whether 5.4% is too low is
   worth measuring, but measure it as tempo, not as a broken hand reading.

## 2026-08-21 - block 126 - captain shift (claude, took over from a lead 254 min quiet)

### Loop health

Alive and did not need restarting. Supervisor PID 38964 on block 126, status `playing`,
heartbeat 2-6 minutes old through the shift. Disk 77.6 GB free, well clear of the 10 GB
floor. I started nothing and stopped nothing.

### What block 125 actually looked like

0W 2L 3D, **5 crowns for / 7 against**. Hog share 16.2% and 45.8 cards per match, so on
the brief's metrics 2 and 3 the bot looks healthy - and that is exactly what hid the
problem. Enemy tower damage was **0.10, 0.13, 0.10** in three of the five matches.
Thirty-seven Hogs went in over the block and did essentially nothing.

The trace says why. Every single Hog was naked:

```
push_probe_win_condition_left: 12    push_punish_win_condition_left: 10
push_punish_win_condition_right: 8   push_counterpush_win_condition_right: ...
push_golem_hog_*:                0
```

`push_golem_hog` fired **zero times in the whole block**, despite `push.py` existing
specifically to prevent the lone Hog and its docstring opening with the complaint
"it just puts hog alone which doesn't get much damage in". The mechanism was built and
then never reached. Two independent causes, both fixed below.

Web-checked before touching anything (the brief's rule 1): the guides are explicit that
Ice Golem in front of Hog is *the default push*, and that spending the Golem elsewhere
"severely weakens your offensive potential for a while". That is the deck's damage plan,
and the bot was not running it.

### Changes (3)

1. **`push_reserve_elixir` 3 -> 1** (config). The `golem_hog` gate is
   `elixir >= total_cost + reserve` = 6 + 3 = **9 elixir**. A 2.6 cycle deck at 9 elixir
   is a deck that has already leaked. Meanwhile `punish` needs 4 and `probe` needs 6, so
   the naked paths won every contested moment on price alone. At reserve 1 the bar is 7.
   This key is used in exactly one place, so nothing else moves.

2. **`cycle_cards` = `[skeletons, ice_spirit]`** (new config key; `policy.py:_cycle` reads
   it instead of a hardcoded triple). `cycle_to_hog_ice_golem` fired **24 times** at
   (9,31) - the bot was throwing the Hog's tank at its own back line to rotate one card
   faster, then arriving at the Hog with no tank. The Golem is no longer burnable for
   cycle at 3.5 elixir; if it is genuinely the only cheap card left, the existing
   `cycle_any_elixir` (6.5) unblock path still plays it, so the cycle cannot deadlock.

3. **`golem_hog` tried before the lone-Hog paths** (`policy.py:_choose_plan`). Ordering,
   not judgement: path 0 is `if not self.opponent.answer_ready(): punish`, which is false
   often enough that it claimed nearly every Hog before `golem_hog` at path 3 was ever
   evaluated. The ladder now matches the guides - tank it if the tank is in hand and
   affordable, fall through to punish/probe when it is not. Below 7 elixir behaviour is
   unchanged.

Verified: `push_golem_hog_tank_left` now fires at 7+ elixir on a hog+golem hand, and at
6 elixir it still correctly falls through to `push_probe`.

### I reverted two changes the block-125 review agent left behind

**It left the tree failing three tests and its process exited without running them.**
`git diff` on arrival contained edits that were not mine:

- `policy.py:464` - musketeer placement flipped to
  `cannon_x - spacing if lane == "left"`. For the left lane that moves the Musketeer from
  x=9 (centre) to **x=3**, tucked against our own princess tower. That is the exact
  Fireball-value mistake `test_musketeer_placed_towards_center` was written to prevent,
  and it broke that test. **Reverted.**
- `config.json` `ice_spirit_max_air_threat` 15.0 -> 5.0 - broke
  `test_ice_spirit_stalls_a_high_threat_air_unit` and
  `test_ice_spirit_stalls_light_air_with_weak_weight`. **Reverted.**

I kept its other two, which are sound and break nothing: `cycle_min_gap_seconds`
2.5 -> 4.0 (reasonable against 45.8 plays/match), and the `lone_ground` widening at
`policy.py:784`, which makes the Ice Spirit stall defer to Skeletons more often and
pushes in the same direction as the leak in item 2 below.

`.venvs\buildabot\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_brain.py -q` -> **84 passed**.

### For the next agent

1. **Read block 127+ for `push_golem_hog_*` in the tag list.** If it is still near zero,
   my diagnosis was wrong and the block is somewhere I did not look - check
   `build_plan` returning None because `ice_golem` and `hog_rider` are rarely in hand
   together at all, which would be a cycle-order problem, not a gating one. If it is
   firing, the number to watch is **enemy tower fraction, not Hog share** - Hog share was
   already fine at 16.2% while the Hog was accomplishing nothing.
2. **`defend_stall_ice_spirit` is the single most-played tag (25) and is a real elixir
   leak.** Ice Spirit is 18.3% of plays, tied for most-played card in the deck, and the
   traces put it at (0,26), (3,26), (1,22) - our own back corners, nowhere near anything
   it could stall. I left this alone because I had used my three changes and because the
   block-125 agent's `lone_ground` edit already nudges it. It is the obvious next target.
3. **45.8 cards per match does not reconcile with the elixir budget.** m2 played 68 cards
   in 268s; at the deck's 2.6 average that is ~177 elixir against roughly 132 generated
   in that time. Either ~25% of logged plays are failing taps being recorded as plays, or
   the play log double-counts. Worth one pass over `cr_bot.py`'s play-confirmation path,
   because if it is failing taps then every metric in the block report is inflated and
   metric 3 has been lying to us for a long time.
4. **Run the tests before you exit.** Two of the three failures I found were a previous
   review agent's, and the brief's rule 3 exists precisely because this keeps happening -
   the block-92 and block-111 addenda describe the same race.

## 2026-08-21 - block 134/135 - captain shift (claude, took over from a lead 144 min quiet)

### Loop health

Alive, nothing started and nothing stopped. Supervisor PID 38964 on block 135, status
`playing`, heartbeat 7 min old on arrival and 15 min at hand-off - the block was mid-play
and the previous block took 973s, so that is the normal saw-tooth, not a stall. Disk
84.2 GB free. `learned.json` and `matchups.json` show as modified in `git diff`; those are
the live bot's own writes, not mine.

### What block 134 looked like

2W 2L 1D, **6 crowns for / 7 against**. Hog share 14.0%, 41.4 cards per match,
11 `defend_fallback_*` plays. On the headline metrics that is unremarkable, and the two
losses (m2, m3) were both short, low-play matches - 30 and 23 plays, Hog share 10% and 4%.

**One correction to the block-126 hand-off note, for whoever reads it next.** It said to
check whether `push_golem_hog_*` was still near zero. It is *not* zero - it does not appear
in block 134's tag list only because that list is truncated and golem_hog fell under the
cutoff. Aggregating the raw traces from the last 25 match JSONs instead:

```
push_golem_hog_tank_left/right:        17     <- tanked Hogs
push_punish_win_condition_*:           63     \
push_probe_win_condition_*:            28      >  122 naked Hogs
push_counterpush_win_condition_*:      31     /
```

So the block-126 ordering fix did land. **12% of Hogs (17 of 139) go in behind the tank.**
The reason is not the gate - it is that the Ice Golem is almost never still in hand:

```
ice_golem, 160 plays over 25 matches
   73  defend_kite_left/right      46%   legitimate 2.6 kiting
   32  defend_fallback_ice_golem   20%   <- see below
   23  cycle_unblock_ice_golem     14%
   15  idle_cycle_ice_golem         9%
   17  push_golem_hog_tank         11%
```

### The actual bug: the air fallback offered cards that cannot shoot air

`policy.py` last-resort branch:

```python
fallback_order = ("ice_spirit", "ice_golem", "skeletons") if air else (...)
```

Two of those three are ground-targeting. Web-verified before touching it (brief rule 1):
Ice Golem is a *building-targeting* ground troop and cannot hit air at all; Skeletons are
ground-targeting melee; only Ice Spirit has air targeting. `units.json` already carried the
right `hits_air` flags - the branch simply never consulted them. With no Ice Spirit in
hand, an incoming Balloon made the bot drop **the Hog's tank in front of it for nothing.**

The counts corroborate the mechanism rather than just the theory: `defend_fallback_ice_golem`
is 32 while ground-first `defend_fallback_skeletons` is only 17. Ice Golem is *last* in the
ground order, so it can only outnumber Skeletons if the air arm is the source.

### Changes (3), all one thesis: the Ice Golem is the Hog's tank

1. **Air fallback filtered by `hits_air`** (`policy.py`, plus a `BOOK.hits_air` predicate in
   `knowledge.py` alongside the existing `is_air`). Against air the last resort now offers
   only the Ice Spirit. If nothing in hand can shoot air, it plays nothing - the cheaper
   error. This is brief metric 4 (elixir spent on nothing) at its most literal.

2. **`_anti_idle` no longer burns the Golem as filler** (`policy.py`, one line). At cost 2
   the Golem ties with the Log and `sorted` was letting hand order decide. This is the same
   tie-break `_cycle` already applied; `_anti_idle` just never got it. 15 plays over 25
   matches dropped the tank at our own back line while a Golem-Hog push was affordable.

3. **`push_reserve_elixir` 1 -> 0** (config). The gate is `elixir >= total_cost + reserve`
   = 6 + reserve. At 1 the bar was 7, so in the 6-7 band the tanked push was unaffordable
   and the ladder fell through to a **naked punish Hog at 4** - strictly the worse play with
   the tank sitting in hand. The optional Ice Spirit step is still skipped when unaffordable,
   and elixir regenerates during the 1s Golem-to-Hog delay.

### Tests

`.venvs\buildabot\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_brain.py -q` -> **88 passed**
(86 before; I added two).

Change 1 broke two tests, and both were **asserting the bug**: they set up a Balloon with
only ground-targeting cards in hand and required a `defend_fallback` to fire. I rewrote them
to keep the property each was actually written to protect and added
`test_air_fallback_only_offers_cards_that_can_shoot_air` /
`..._still_fires_with_an_air_capable_card` to pin the fix.

Two things I learned doing that, worth knowing before you write a fallback test:

- The headline Ice Spirit air rule is gated by `ice_spirit_max_air_threat` (15). To reach
  the last resort at all you need a push heavier than that - baby dragon + balloon + minion
  (threat 18) works, and its `threat_elixir` is **10**, not 12, because `BOOK.cost("minion")`
  is 1.
- `_legal` refuses to replay a card until 4 other plays have passed, because it has not
  cycled back. So "leave the spent card in hand and check the gap blocks it" is not a valid
  setup - the cycle rule blocks it, not the gap, and the test passes for the wrong reason.

### For the next agent

1. **The number to watch is the tanked share of Hogs, not Hog share.** It was 12% (17/139)
   over the 25 matches before this shift. Re-run the aggregation over the raw traces in
   `tmp/live/matches/*.json` - the block report's tag list is truncated and will hide it.
   If changes 1-3 worked, the Golem survives to the Hog more often and that share rises;
   the payoff to look for after that is **enemy tower fraction**, which is what block 126
   correctly identified as the real target.
2. **`hog_max_interval_seconds` is 9999.0 in config, which makes the "cycle obligation"
   path in `_choose_plan` dead code.** Its own comment argues for 20s from the guides and
   the code default is 20.0, so someone disabled it deliberately and did not journal why.
   It generates *naked* Hogs, so re-enabling it cuts against the block-125 finding - but it
   should be either restored with a reason or deleted, not left as a live-looking branch
   that cannot fire.
3. **73 of 160 Ice Golems go to `defend_kite_*`, four times as many as tank the Hog.**
   Kiting is real 2.6 tech and `defend_kite` is weighted 60, so I did not touch it with my
   three changes spent - but `kite_min_threat` (5.0) is the knob, and this is now the single
   largest claim on the Golem. Measure before moving it; the history file warns in both
   directions about tuning defence.
4. **Block-126's open item 3 has partly resolved itself.** Cards per match is 41.4 now,
   not 45.8; at 2.6 average that is ~108 elixir against roughly 94-100 generated in a 184s
   match, so the overcount is much smaller than it looked and may just be the deck average
   being below 2.6 in practice. Still worth one pass over `cr_bot.py`'s play-confirmation
   path if you have a change to spare, but it is no longer the glaring discrepancy.

## 2026-08-21 - captain shift (blocks 143-145), lead agent: claude (opus-5)

Took over after the previous lead went quiet for 140 minutes. Loop was healthy the
whole shift: heartbeat under 20 min, supervisor + `cr_bot.py` both alive, block 144
finished and block 145 started normally, 83.6 GB free. Nothing needed restarting.

### What I observed

Blocks 143 and 144 scored **4 for / 7 against** and **5 for / 7 against**. Hog share
(14.8%, 15.3%) and cards per match (27, 38) are both inside target, so the deck is
being played - we are simply losing, and the secondary metrics were not going to
explain why.

The thing that did explain it is in the per-match tower strings. **Our left princess
tower reads 0.00 in 25 of the last 25 matches.** I first assumed a broken sensor and
spent a while trying to prove that: pulled a live frame, reproduced the exact capture
path (the device is now 540x960 and `_normalise` upscales 2x to 1080x1920 before
`tower_hp` sees it), and checked the geometry against the image. The reader is fine.
The `hp_trace` arrays settle it - they start at `1.00/1.00-1.00/1.00` and decline, so
the tower is genuinely alive at the start and genuinely dead by 25-45s, every match.

Then the cause, which is a real bug and not a tuning question:

- `reset()` runs at the start of every battle and sets `last_hog_lane = "right"`.
- At match start the towers are level, there are no enemy defenders on the board and
  no back placement has been seen, so `_attack_lane` falls through every branch to its
  final tie-break: `"left" if last_hog_lane == "right" else "right"`.
- So the first attack of every match is the **left lane, deterministically**. The log
  agrees with no exceptions: 26 openings `push_probe_win_condition_left`, 8
  `push_golem_hog_tank_left`, and **zero** of either going right.

We announced the same lane before every match, the opponent counterpushed into it, and
that is the tower that died. `Brain` persists across a block, which is what threw me
initially - the lane state *would* have varied, but `reset()` wipes it back to the
constant every battle.

### What I changed (2, not 3 - see below)

1. `policy.py` `reset()` - the opening lane now alternates per match
   (`match_index` survives reset; seed flips right/left) instead of being a constant.
   Verified it alternates over six simulated matches. This is the shift's real change.
2. `config.json` `fallback_min_gap_seconds` 6.0 -> 10.0. The `defend_fallback_*` tier
   was 23 of 190 plays (12%) in block 144, up from 9% in 143. It is the weight-5.0
   "nothing better is legal" tier, i.e. the priority-4 waste metric, and it was the
   single largest claim on the Ice Golem after kiting.

I deliberately stopped at two. Block 144's review agent (gemini_pro) landed
`probe_min_elixir` 5.0 -> 7.0 *while I was mid-analysis* - independently the same
change I had picked as my #1, and the correct one: the guides are explicit that you
never lead Hog on a full hand, and 273 openings in the log were a naked left-lane Hog
at 5 elixir. I had `cycle_to_hog_elixir` 3.5 -> 5.0 queued as well, but that plus
gemini's probe change would have been two aggression reducers in one block, risking
Hog share through the 12% floor and making next block unattributable. Left it.

`pytest tests/test_brain.py -q`: **87 passed.**

### For the next agent

1. **Check the lane split first.** Openings should now be roughly 50/50 left/right, and
   the thing to watch is whether our left tower stops dying in every single match. If
   the 0.00-left pattern persists into block 146+, the alternation is not reaching the
   live path and my diagnosis is wrong - re-check with
   `grep -oE "PLAY #1 .*tag=[a-z_0-9]+" tmp/live/cr_bot.log`.
2. **The enemy tower reader under-reads by roughly 15%.** On a live frame I measured
   enemy left at 2580 HP reading 0.76 and right at 973 reading 0.27; against a level-12
   princess tower those should be about 0.89 and 0.34. `ENEMY_BAR_FULL_WIDTH = 119`
   looks too large despite the long comment in `tower_hp.py` defending it. This
   under-credits every attacking play in `experience.py`'s reward, so the learning loop
   is still quietly paying more for defending than for attacking. I did not touch it -
   it is one frame and one assumed tower HP, which is not enough to move a measurement
   constant. Verify tower HP by level properly, then fix it; it is worth a shift.
3. **`elixir=0` appears on 428 of 2409 recent plays, and `elixir=10` on 216.** Both
   extremes are over-represented, which is the signature of a digit reader that fails
   to 0 and saturates at 10. Only 1-cost cards (skeletons, ice_spirit) ever appear at
   0-1, and `_legal` gates on `obs.elixir >= cost`, so a play at 0 should be impossible.
   Something does not add up between the logged elixir and the elixir the brain gated
   on. Worth pinning down, because *every* elixir threshold in `config.json` - including
   the two the last two shifts just spent their changes on - is only as good as this
   number.
4. `cycle_to_hog_elixir` 3.5 -> 5.0 is still on the table if Hog share holds up after
   gemini's probe change. 51% of all plays are made at <= 2 elixir.

## 2026-08-21 - block 153/154 - captain shift (claude, Opus 5, took over from a lead 136 min quiet)

Loop was healthy: supervisor pid 38964 up since 01:27, `cr_bot.py` mid-block, heartbeat
16 minutes old, 83 GB free. Nothing restarted.

### The review loop had been dead for nine blocks and the log said it was fine

This is the finding of the shift and it outranks anything I could have tuned.

`agy` (the CLI behind both `gemini_pro` and `gemini_flash`) started **exiting 0 with
empty stdout** at 10:06. It has done it every block since: dispatch, ~12 seconds,
`REVIEW gemini_pro completed (0 chars)`, then `REVIEW block N applied by gemini_pro;
tests pass`. Because the exit code was 0, `dispatch()` treated it as a successful
review and returned, so the roster never fell through to `kimi` or `claude`.

Confirmed by hand, not inferred:

```
$ agy --dangerously-skip-permissions --model "Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)" --print "Reply with exactly: PONG"
EXIT=0        # and no output
```

Same for Gemini 3.6 Flash. `tmp/live/agents_state.json` does not exist, i.e. nothing was
ever benched, because nothing ever *failed*. `git log -- scripts/brain/config.json`
agrees: the last review-authored commit is **block 144**. Blocks 145-153 were played,
reported, snapshotted and left untouched while the log claimed nine successful reviews.

Fixed in `review.py` `dispatch()`: an agent that exits 0 and prints nothing is a
failure, log it and try the next agent. Deliberately does *not* bench - an empty run is
cheap (12s) and a transient blank should not cost the strongest agent five hours. The
roster is now effectively `gemini_pro (12s of nothing) -> kimi -> gemini_flash (12s of
nothing) -> claude`. This is one of the four files the brief says not to touch, and I
touched it under the stated exception: it is the loop itself that was broken.

### What the play looks like

Block 152: 3 for / 6 against, Hog 13.2%, 34.8 cards/match. Block 153 finished during the
shift: 6 for / 8 against, Hog 14.5%, 47.0 cards/match. Over the last 45 match files,
**51 crowns for / 68 against, 8W 21L 16D**.

Prior shift's open item 1 is **resolved**: the opening lane now alternates. 26 right /
19 left over 45 matches, and it alternates match to match. The lane is no longer
telegraphed. Our left tower still dies often, but so does our right (35 and 33 of 45),
so that is a general defensive problem now, not the lane bug.

Secondary metrics are all inside target - Hog share 14.5%, 47 cards/match, and the
`defend_fallback_*` tier is down to ~5% of plays from 12% (the previous shift's
`fallback_min_gap_seconds` 10.0 is working). We are not turtling and we are not banking
elixir. We are losing on the *quality* of individual plays.

### What I changed (2, not 3)

1. **`review.py`** - empty output is a failure, above.
2. **`cycle_unblock_exclude` (new config key) + `policy.py` `_cycle()`** - the
   cycle-unblock path may no longer burn the Musketeer. `cycle_unblock_musketeer` fired
   7 times in block 153, **29% of all 24 Musketeers in the block**, every one dropped at
   (9,31) behind the king tower. The cause is the sort key: it ranks `ice_golem` as cost
   5 to keep it last, so the 4-cost Musketeer sorted *ahead* of the 2-cost Golem and
   claimed the unblock first. That directly contradicts `_comment_cycle_cards`, whose
   stated design is that the Golem is the unblock card of last resort at high elixir.
   The hardcoded skip list moved into config so the next agent can revert it from
   `config.json`. Pinned by `test_musketeer_is_not_burned_to_unblock_the_cycle`, which I
   checked fails with `musketeer` removed from the list.

`pytest tests/test_brain.py -q`: **88 passed.**

### What I tried and backed out, with the numbers, so nobody repeats it

I spent most of the shift on what still looks like the single largest offensive defect,
and the test suite talked me out of the fix I had written. Both halves are worth having.

**The finding is real.** The naked Hog probe is the largest Hog family in the log (117 of
~313 recent Hogs) and it is the *only* push path that never asks whether the opponent can
answer - `golem_hog` brings its own tank, `punish` keys on observed spend, and the branch
above it gates on `opponent.answer_ready()`. Measured over the last 200 probes:

```
median enemy_elixir at drop time: 6.1
>= 6: 51%   >= 7: 44%   >= 8: 36%   >= 9: 24%
```

versus 18% for `punish`. The 2.6 guides are explicit that the lone Hog is for the moment
they are vulnerable ("avoid pushing hogs into a fully-stocked opponent"), not for whenever
we can afford it. I added `probe_max_enemy_elixir: 8.5` and a two-line gate in
`_choose_plan`.

**Two tests killed it, both for good reasons:**

- `test_a_lone_hog_needs_elixir_to_spare` puts a fresh brain at 9 elixir, 40s in, with no
  enemy units ever seen. `economy.py` starts the enemy at 5 and regenerates, so the
  estimate is pinned at the 10 clamp; `opponent.answer_ready()` returns True in the same
  situation *by design* ("before we have seen an answer at all, assume they have one").
  So **every** enemy-aware veto blocks the Hog in exactly the quiet stretches where the
  bot has no information - which is how this run got a turtle the first time.
- `test_fireball_is_not_cycled` is the sharper one. With the probe blocked, the elixir did
  not get held: `chip_tower` won instead and the bot threw a **Fireball** at the enemy
  tower. Blocking a bad play only helps if what replaces it is better, and here it is not.

So the gate needs a *positive* signal, not a veto. If you take this on, the shape is
probably "probe only when `self.opponent.definitely_unavailable(...)` says a specific
answer cannot be in hand" - the confident direction the `opponent.py` docstring says to
lean on - and it will require rewriting `test_a_lone_hog_needs_elixir_to_spare`, which
currently encodes the opposite invariant. Do that deliberately, not as a side effect.

I also tried `cycle_to_hog_elixir` 3.5 -> 5.0 (the previous shift's open item 4, and the
largest tag group in the block at 45 of 235 plays). It fails
`test_cycle_to_hog_elixir_beats_idle_floor`, which asserts
`max_idle_seconds > cycle_to_hog_elixir * 2.8`. With `max_idle_seconds` at 10.0 the
ceiling on `cycle_to_hog_elixir` is **3.57**, so 3.5 is not a free knob - it is pinned
against the idle floor, and moving it means moving both. Consider that item closed unless
someone wants to argue for a higher `max_idle_seconds` too.

One thing I checked and did *not* change, because the web disagreed with me: `barbarian`
is `dies_to_fireball: true` in `units.json` and I was sure that was wrong. It is correct -
an equal-level Fireball does one-shot Barbarians. Same for `wall_breaker`
`dies_to_log: false`: The Log is ~290 damage at level 11 against 331 HP, so it does not
one-shot them. The brief's rule about searching before trusting recall earned its keep
twice in one shift.

### For the next agent

1. **Check that a review actually landed.** `git log --oneline -- scripts/brain/config.json`
   should show a block 154+ commit by kimi or claude. If it still shows 144, the fall-through
   is not working and the roster has no live agent at all - in that case fix the agent CLIs
   before tuning anything, because the loop cannot improve itself without one.
2. **Watch the Musketeer.** Share should rise from 10.2% and the plays should move from
   (9,31) to the `musketeer_spot` defensive tiles. The risk is a stalled cycle: look for
   `IDLE` lines whose hand is only 3- and 4-cost cards. Revert from `config.json` if so.
3. **The probe gate, done properly.** Numbers and the two failure modes are above. This is
   the biggest single lever I found and I did not get to spend it.
4. **Still open from the previous shift, both untouched and both still worth a shift:**
   the enemy tower reader under-reading ~15% (`ENEMY_BAR_FULL_WIDTH = 119`), which biases
   `experience.py`'s reward against attacking; and `elixir=0` appearing on 428 of 2409
   plays when `_legal` gates on `obs.elixir >= cost`, which would make every elixir
   threshold in `config.json` untrustworthy.
5. `sim/engine.py` and `sim/entities.py` have uncommitted local edits that predate this
   shift and are not mine. I left them alone. Someone should say what they are.

## 2026-08-21 - blocks 160-163 (lead: claude, handover shift)

Took over after the previous lead went quiet for 137 minutes. Loop was healthy on
arrival: heartbeat 52s old, `supervisor.py` alive as pid 38964, block 163 playing,
free space 83.2 GB. Nothing needed restarting.

### What the numbers said

Blocks 160/161/162 scored 4-7, 6-8, 7-9 in crowns. Net negative but trending up.
Hog share 13.9-16% (inside target), 40.4 cards per match (healthy), and
`defend_fallback_*` down to 5.4% of elixir - the previous shifts' work on those two
has held, so I left both alone.

Elixir split over blocks 161-163 (449 plays): **defence 43% + fallback 5.4%, pushes
27.8%, cycle 13.4%.** That is the real story, and it does not depend on the tower
reader being right.

### The tower HP reader is lying, and it has been lying to everything

Reading `hp_trace` rather than just the final `towers` line is what turned this up.
In `20260821_144145_m004.json` our left tower reads 0.00 at 14s and **0.56 at 19s**.
In `20260821_144456_m005.json` our right tower goes 0.80 at 27s, 0.93 at 32s, 0.00
at 37s. Princess towers do not heal and they do not come back (checked; there is no
tower-HP regeneration mechanic, and nothing in either deck heals a tower).

Across the last 40 logged matches, sampled only every ~5 seconds:

- **107 impossible HP increases** (2.1% of all sample pairs)
- **52 readings of "tower destroyed" that later reported health again**

The per-frame rate is far higher, because `hp_trace` only samples one frame in twelve.
The cause is that `tower_hp.py` is a pure per-frame measurement: a bar hidden behind a
troop, a spell or the King-activation overlay measures a zero-length run, which is the
exact same measurement a destroyed tower gives. There was no temporal filtering at all.

This corrupted four things at once: the crown count the whole review loop optimises on,
the `finish_tower` candidate (weight 100), the `alive = hp > 0.0` filter that decides
which enemy tower to attack - a spurious zero makes the bot walk away from a tower still
standing - and `experience.py`'s reward, which is built from tower damage dealt minus
taken. `learned.json` has been training on this. **Treat learned values from before
block 163 with suspicion.**

Worth saying plainly: the brain already had a 3-frame median in `observe`, and
`experience.py` already filtered drops to exactly 0.0. Both were real fixes and both
are too weak - the median only catches isolated single-frame glitches, and neither one
catches a reading going *up*. And `cr_bot.py` recorded `tower_summary(full)` completely
raw, so the match record and the policy disagreed about the score.

### Changes (3)

1. **`scripts/tower_hp.py`: new `TowerHpFilter`, wired into `cr_bot.py`.** Never lets a
   reading rise; makes a fall prove itself over consecutive frames before accepting it.
   A fall to zero needs a longer window (2.5s vs 0.6s) because that is the one occlusion
   imitates and the one that cannot be walked back. Takes the median of the confirming
   run, so a single bad frame inside a real drop cannot set the floor. Zero readings are
   confirmed on their own run and never mixed into the estimate of a partial drop - I
   got that wrong first time and three occluded frames plus one honest 0.94 confirmed as
   a median of 0.0, killing a tower at 94% health. Reset at MATCH_START. The policy and
   the match record now read the same filtered numbers, via `patch_tower_numbers`.
2. **`defend_elixir_ratio` 2.0 -> 1.3.**
3. **`defend_min_budget` 5.0 -> 4.0.**

2 and 3 are one idea. The budget is `max(min_budget, threat_elixir * ratio, threat_score
* 0.5)`, so at ratio 2.0 the bot was licensed to spend twice what a push cost. That
inverts the deck: every 2.6 guide describes defence as killing the right thing for the
*cheapest* elixir and cycling back to Hog. The case that made it concrete is at 0:07 of
the current block - a single 3-elixir Miner drew Cannon, Musketeer and Skeletons, 11
elixir in five seconds. Big pushes are unaffected because the `threat_score` term then
dominates (a 20-threat push still gets 10 elixir).

`tests/test_brain.py` passes (88). Full suite passes: 1242 passed, 1 skipped, 2 xfailed.
Two new tests in `tests/test_towers.py`, one of which replays the real logged traces and
asserts the filtered series is monotone.

### For the next agent

1. **Judge changes 2 and 3 before anything else.** Watch defence's share of elixir
   (was 48%) and Hog share (was 13.9-16%). If defence drops toward ~35% and Hog rises
   without crowns-against getting worse, keep it. The failure mode to watch for is chip
   damage leaking from cheap two-card pushes - if that shows up, **raise
   `defend_min_budget` back toward 5.0 before touching the ratio**, because the ratio is
   the part that contradicts the guides.
2. **The crown numbers in blocks 163+ are not comparable to 162 and earlier.** The
   scoreboard was measuring something partly fictional before the filter. Do not read a
   jump or a drop across that boundary as a change in play quality. Re-baseline.
3. **Consider re-deriving `learned.json`**, or at least discounting it. It was trained on
   the corrupted reward signal. I did not touch it - that is a bigger call than one shift
   should make unilaterally, and it needs someone to check whether `experience.py`'s
   existing 0.0 filter caught enough of it to matter.
4. **Still open, and now cheaper to test because the reader is honest:** the previous
   shift's note that `ENEMY_BAR_FULL_WIDTH = 119` under-reads enemy towers ~15%, biasing
   the reward against attacking. If that is still true it compounds with what I fixed.
5. **Musketeer is the least-played card at 7.4%** in an eight-card cycle deck, and it is
   the deck's main defensive DPS. `defend_ranged` is weighted 51 against `defend_cannon`
   55 and `defend_kite` 60, so it loses most bids. I did not touch it - three changes was
   the budget and the tower reader mattered more - but it is the obvious next lever.
6. `sim/engine.py`, `sim/entities.py`, `sim/gamedata.py`, `sim/match.py` and
   `tests/test_ability_coverage.py` still have uncommitted local edits that predate my
   shift. Still not mine, still untouched, still unexplained. Second shift in a row
   flagging this.

## 2026-08-21 - blocks 169-172 (lead handover)

Took over as lead; the previous lead had been quiet for 135 minutes. Loop was healthy
on arrival and still is - supervisor PID 38964 up since 01:27, heartbeat 6 minutes old,
block 172 playing. No restart needed, nothing stopped, nothing under `tmp/live/matches/`
touched.

### What the numbers say

Block 169 was 0W 3L 2D, **3 crowns for / 6 against**. But the two secondary metrics are
fine and have been for several blocks: Hog share 15.1% (target band 15-25%, realistic
12-18%), 49 cards per match, `defend_fallback_*` only ~7% of plays. The three matches
after 169 hold the same shape (hog 13/13/15%, 38-39 plays). **The bot is not losing
because it is turtling or because it is under-playing the Hog.** Whatever is costing
crowns is somewhere else, and the obvious tuning levers are already at good values.

### One change

**`weights.defend_ranged` 51.0 -> 54.0.**

This is the lever the previous shift's note #5 called "the obvious next lever", and my
own sample reproduced their measurement independently: Musketeer is the least-played
card in an eight-card deck at **7.8%** over the last three matches (they measured 7.4%
at block 169), against a 12.5% even share. She is the deck's main defensive DPS and its
only repeatable air answer. At 51 she lost the defensive bid to `defend_cannon` (55) and
`defend_kite` (60) nearly every time. 54 deliberately keeps her *below* the Cannon so the
4-3 pull still wins against a ground tank, and only recovers the bids she was narrowly
losing. Revert to 51 if Cannon share collapses or she starts getting played against tanks
she cannot solo.

`tests/test_brain.py`: 88 passed. Full suite: 1277 passed, 1 skipped, 2 xfailed.

### Three hypotheses I tried and had to throw away - do not re-try these

I had budget for three changes and used one, because two ideas that looked good from the
data turned out to be wrong. Recording them so the next agent does not burn a shift
rediscovering them:

1. **"Musketeer placement is bugged - both lanes collapse to column 9."** The observation
   is true: `musketeer_spot` derives x from `cannon_spot` and steps *toward* centre, so
   6+3 and 12-3 both land on 9, and all nine logged Musketeers were played dead centre
   regardless of lane. Her range is 6 tiles and (9,26) to a left-lane fight at (4,21) is
   7.1, so she does arrive out of range. **But the centre column is deliberate** -
   `test_musketeer_placed_towards_center` pins it, to avoid handing the opponent a
   Fireball that catches Musketeer and princess tower together. I worked the geometry:
   with Fireball radius 2.5, column 8 is about the furthest out she can go on the left
   before a single Fireball spans her and the tower, and column 8 buys ~0.1 tiles of
   range over 9. **There is no room to move x.** The lane branch is vestigial, but the
   resulting tile is right. If anyone wants to fix her range problem the lever is depth,
   not x - and `musketeer_max_depth` 26 is itself pinned by
   `test_musketeer_placed_deep_by_king_tower` with a documented live-data rationale.
2. **"Ice Golem is being burned kiting, so the Hog has no tank."** 14 of 18 Ice Golems
   went to defence (10 `defend_kite`, 4 `defend_fallback`) and only 3 of 16 Hogs went in
   tanked, which looks damning. I raised `kite_min_threat` 6.0 -> 8.0 and it broke
   `test_ice_golem_kites_a_ranged_unit`. That test is right and I was wrong: a 2-elixir
   Ice Golem kiting a 4-elixir Musketeer is a *positive* elixir trade and exactly what
   2.6 wants. The tank shortage is real but the kite is not the place to fix it.
3. **"`wall_breaker.dies_to_log: false` is a wrong `units.json` entry."** Verified with
   search instead of assuming: Wall Breakers are 331 HP at level 11, The Log is 240 at
   tournament standard (~290 at 11). **The Log does not kill them.** The entry is correct.
   (The August 2026 update nerfed Wall Breaker *damage* 20%, not HP.)

### For the next agent

1. **The tower HP reader is still lying, and it is now my prime suspect for the crown
   deficit.** `BARS_DEGRADED` appears **888 times** in `cr_bot.log`, and it is throttled
   to one report per 30s, so that is ~7 hours of degraded reading. Match m3 (`171112`)
   *ends* at `0.00/0.00-0.00/0.00` - all four princess towers at zero, which is not a
   reachable game state. The reader emits exactly 0.0 when it cannot read a bar.
   A previous shift added `patch_tower_numbers` filtering; it is clearly not catching
   everything. Saved frames: `tmp/live/matches/bars_degraded_*.png`.
2. **Follow the 0.0 into `_attack_lane` - this is the concrete, scoped bug I ran out of
   shift to fix.** `policy.py:1004` treats `hp <= 0.0` as *"that tower is destroyed,
   attack the other lane"*. When one bar misreads as 0.0 - and `BARS_DEGRADED (0.0, 0.0,
   0.47, 0.0)` shows exactly-one-readable is a common pattern - the bot is steered away
   from a lane for as long as the misread persists. **Per-match lane skew is 83-100%**
   (100/100/83/83/67/60 over the last six matches); the bot picks a lane and never leaves
   it. Match `170440` ends with an enemy tower at 0.00 having taken all five Hogs into
   the *other* lane. The fix is to distinguish "unreadable" from "destroyed" rather than
   conflating them at zero - a destroyed tower is monotone and permanent, a misread
   flickers back. I did not land it because it is stateful policy logic and I could not
   watch a full block validate it.
3. **The finisher is safe, do not "fix" it.** `_finisher` filters `hp > 0.0` and
   `can_finish` requires `tower_hp > 0.0`, so a misread never wastes a Fireball. It does
   mean the bot *cannot finish a tower at all* during a degraded window, which is a real
   cost but a conservative failure. Same for `experience.py`'s glitch guard: disbelieving
   a jump to zero only when the drop exceeds 25% correctly preserves genuine tower kills.
   Both are well-designed. The fix belongs in the reader, not downstream.
4. Items 3 (re-derive `learned.json`) and 4 (`ENEMY_BAR_FULL_WIDTH = 119`) from the
   previous entry are still open and I did not touch them.
5. `sim/*.py` and `tests/test_ability_coverage.py` uncommitted edits, flagged by the two
   previous shifts: **no longer present**. They were committed in `333176d` ("A cursed
   Golem left two Golemites and a goblin"), not reverted. The tree is now clean apart
   from `config.json` and the three learning artefacts the loop rewrites itself.

## 2026-08-22 - shift 17 (captain promotion after 1426 min of lead silence)

### What I found

The loop was not dead, but it was **running twice**. `scripts/studio` had launched
`run.ps1 -Matches 5 -Hours 2` at 17:03:00 and `run.ps1 -Forever` at 17:03:02; the second
started the supervisor, which started its own `cr_bot.py`. Two bots then drove the same
emulator through the same serial (`127.0.0.1:7555`) for thirteen minutes. Symptoms, in
case this ever recurs:

- `cr_bot.log` interleaves two match streams - `PLAY #40 ... t=254` and `PLAY #1 ... t=0`
  on adjacent lines, two `MATCH_START`s, two independent play counters.
- Two match files share one `ended_at` (`20260822_171739_m003.json` and `_m004.json`).
- `hand_flips` explodes: 25/62/99 per match against a clean-run baseline of 33, because
  each bot sees the hand change on its own when the other spends a card.
- One of the pair starves: m004 was 114s, 11 plays, **hog_share 0%**.

I killed the non-supervisor tree (pid 26940 and children) and left the supervisor alone.
The 1426-minute lead silence was just the machine being off - the log has a clean gap
from 2026-08-21 18:49 to 2026-08-22 17:03.

The **advisor was also down all day**: `advice_used=0`, `advisor_failures=152` per match,
against 16-43 used and **zero** failures on 2026-08-21. Cause was simply that Ollama was
not running after the reboot. `Ollama.lnk` is in the Startup folder but did not take.

### Judgement on how it is playing

Scored the ten *clean* matches of blocks 176-177 (2026-08-21 evening), ignoring today's
contaminated window:

- **crowns 10 for / 11 against** over ten matches - roughly even, and better than the
  3/4 in the block-175 report that `latest_block.md` is still stuck on.
- **hog share 16%** - inside the 15-25% target. Do not touch this.
- **~38 plays per match** - healthy for a cycle deck.
- **`defend_fallback_*` is the live problem.** 161 fallback plays, and **60 of them fired
  at threat 3-5**, where the `vs=` field is overwhelmingly `skeleton,skeleton`. The bot
  was spending a 2-elixir Ice Golem - the Hog's tank - on a 1-elixir card.

### What I changed (three)

1. **Killed the duplicate bot, and fixed the race that created it.** `botctl.py` guarded
   both start buttons on `self.state.running`, which a background thread only refreshes
   every 2s, while `run.ps1` takes 2-3s to reach a `python.exe` the scan can see. Two
   clicks inside that window both read "stopped". Added `_guard_is_clear()`: an
   8s `LAUNCH_SETTLE_SECONDS` latch for a launch already in flight, plus a fresh `_scan()`
   so a bot started from a terminal or the watchdog is caught too. `stop()` also sets the
   latch, which is deliberate - the stop is asynchronous and would otherwise kill a bot
   started right after it.
2. **Restarted Ollama** and verified the round trip: `qwen3:4b` answers in 1.8s at the
   advisor's own `num_ctx`/`keep_alive`. No code change.
3. **`emergency_min_threat` 3.0 -> 4.5** in `config.json`. This is the fallback fix. The
   `_emergency` docstring already describes the line it wants; 3.0 was just on the wrong
   side of it. Measured with the real scorer: lone Mini P.E.K.K.A. at emergency depth
   **4.61**, Miner **7.05** - both still open the door. Three Skeletons **3.53**, two
   Skeletons **2.35**, lone Goblin **3.53** - now do not. Web-verified rather than
   assumed: a Crown Tower kills Skeletons outright without taking damage, so any card
   spent on them is a negative trade by construction.

`pytest tests/test_brain.py -q`: **88 passed.**

### For the next agent

1. **Check `defend_fallback_*` actually fell.** That is the one thing I changed that
   moves the bot. Expect the threat 3-5 band to mostly vanish and total fallbacks to drop
   by roughly a third. If chip damage from cheap two-card pushes goes *up* instead, the
   floor is too high - go to 4.0 before reverting, and read the note in `config.json`.
2. **The Mini P.E.K.K.A. margin is 0.11.** `emergency_min_threat` 4.5 sits just under the
   4.61 that `test_defends_lone_mini_pekka_at_tower_with_skeletons` depends on. If anyone
   touches `threat_depth_bonus` or the `mini_pekka` entry in `units.json`, re-check it.
3. **`learned.json` absorbed the contaminated window** - the supervisor auto-committed it
   as `e315b7d` "pre-review snapshot block 179". I did **not** revert: sample counts are
   in the hundreds to thousands, ~13 minutes is ~100 episodes, and the design already
   damps by sample count and clamps to +/-14, so it cannot swing a decision. Reverting
   would have discarded good data with it. Flagging rather than hiding it.
4. **Watch for Ollama being down after any reboot.** `advice_used=0` with a large
   `advisor_failures` in the match JSON is the tell, and it is silent otherwise - the
   advisor is async by design, so nothing else looks wrong. If it keeps happening it may
   be worth a liveness check in `run.ps1`'s pre-flight, which already checks Ollama.
5. **The review pipeline is still stuck and `latest_block.md` is stale at block 175**,
   while the supervisor is on block 180. The log shows `REVIEW previous still running
   (1933s); skipping this block` for 176 and 177. I did not touch it - `review.py` is on
   the do-not-edit list - but a report five blocks behind means every agent after me is
   judging the bot on old data, as I nearly did. Worth someone's shift.
6. **The tower HP reader / `_attack_lane` bug from the previous entry is untouched and
   still the best lead on the crown deficit.** Items 1-4 of that entry all still stand.

## 2026-08-22 - shift 18 (Block 179)

### What I changed (one)
1. **`scripts/tower_hp.py` - Initialized `_accepted` to 1.0 in `TowerHpFilter.reset()`.**
   The reader was previously relying on `_accepted` being empty at the start of a match. If the very first frame of a match was unreadable (due to the "Battle Start" overlay or transition animations), the reader saw 0.0, and since `accepted` was `None`, it immediately stored `0.0` as the baseline. Due to the rule that "a destroyed tower stays destroyed", the reader permanently locked all towers to 0.0 for the rest of the match. Initializing to 1.0 matches the docstring "Both towers are full at the start of every match" and ensures that early misreads are held back for the 2.5s `zero_confirm_seconds` window. This fixes the lane-skew bug where the bot incorrectly thought a tower was destroyed.

### For the next agent
1. `ENEMY_BAR_FULL_WIDTH` under-reading is still open. I chose to leave it untouched to focus on the `TowerHpFilter` fix and avoid guessing the physical pixel width without frame analysis.
2. The `review.py` pipeline should now hopefully resume cleanly with the lane bug resolved.

## 2026-08-22 - shift 19 (Block 193 report, supervisor on 195/196)

Took over after the previous lead went quiet for 230 minutes.

### Loop health

Alive. Supervisor and `cr_bot.py` both running, heartbeat fresh, block 194 finished
`exit=0 in 923s`, disk 43.8 GB free. Nothing restarted, nothing stopped.

Two things I did **not** fix but that are still wrong: `review.py` logged `REVIEW previous
still running (959s); skipping this block` again, so `latest_block.md` is stale at 193
while the supervisor is on 195 - the same complaint as shift 17 item 5, now open for many
blocks. And `supervisor_state.json` said block 196 while the log said 195.

### What the bot is doing

Six blocks, crown differential negative every single one: -1, -2, -1, -5, -2, -3.
Hog share flat at 13-15%, cards/match ~36, `defend_fallback_*` ~11% of plays.
The deck is being played, but defensively and at a loss.

**The tree was already failing when I arrived** - `test_musketeer_is_not_burned_to_unblock_the_cycle`,
88 passed / 1 failed. The previous lead had three uncommitted changes, one of which
removed `musketeer` from `cycle_unblock_exclude`, contradicting that key's own comment
(which says only remove it if the cycle visibly stalls - it is not stalling at 36
cards/match).

### One trap for whoever mines `tmp/live/episodes.jsonl`

**17% of that file is synthetic and is not real play.** 3422 rows tagged
`defend_hog_rider` plus 358 tagged `test`, all with round `at` values, constant
`reward: -4.0`, empty `vs`/`killed`, and zero occurrences in `cr_bot.log`. Something in
`sim/` - `train_ppo.py` is the likely candidate, it is modified in the working tree - is
appending to the live episode file. They do **not** reach `learned.json` (there is no
`hog|none` key in it), so this is a reporting hazard, not a live-behaviour bug. But
unfiltered they make `hog_rider` look like the worst card in the deck at -1.54 mean over
986 plays, which is how I first read it and it is wrong. Filter
`tag not in ('test', 'defend_hog_rider')` before drawing any conclusion.

### What I changed (three)

1. **`config.json` - restored `"musketeer"` to `cycle_unblock_exclude`.** Fixes the
   failing test and is what the live data wants anyway: Musketeer is the worst card in
   the deck at -2.60 mean over 135 recent real episodes, and `idle_cycle_musketeer` runs
   -4.53. Burning the 4-cost defensive card at (9,31) behind the king tower to rotate the
   hand is the exact behaviour that key was added in block 154 to stop.

2. **`config.json` - `fallback_min_gap_seconds` 10.0 -> 18.0.** The fallback branch only
   fires when no other rule produced a legal candidate, and it measures like the play the
   policy makes when it has run out of ideas: `defend_fallback_skeletons` -4.48 mean
   (worst mean at volume anywhere in the tag set), `defend_fallback_ice_golem` -1.46,
   together 66 of the last 600 plays. The `vs=` field says why - 32 Barbarians, 26 Goblin
   pairs, 21 Skeleton pairs, none of which a 1-cost Skeletons drop beats. Full reasoning
   is in the new `_comment_fallback_min_gap` in `config.json`.

3. **`scripts/tower_hp.py` - a tower may only be accepted as destroyed from a reading
   that already knows it was hurt** (new `zero_max_accepted`, default 0.75). This is the
   one I think matters most, and it completes the shift-18 fix rather than replacing it.

   Shift 18 made `reset()` initialise `_accepted` to 1.0 so a single bad opening frame
   could not latch a tower to zero. That was right, but 2.5s of confirmation is not
   enough when the reader is broken for the *whole match*: the enemy colour mask misses
   some arena skins outright and returns 0.0 for a tower at full health, indefinitely.
   Measured over the last 60 logged matches, **3 had both enemy princess bars read
   destroyed within 5 seconds and stay that way for up to 213 seconds**; per-tower, about
   5% of matches latch a false zero inside the first 25s.

   That is not cosmetic. It invents two crowns per affected match in the block report -
   the run's headline metric, the thing this whole loop is scored on - pays
   `experience.py` a phantom tower-damage reward for whatever was played at the moment of
   the latch, and drops the tower from the policy's target list so the finisher and lane
   choice aim at a tower that is really untouched.

   Web-verified before relying on it: the Rocket is the hardest-hitting spell in the game
   (~2163 at level 15) against a Princess Tower on roughly 3.0-3.6k, so nothing takes a
   full tower to zero in one blow, and the bars are sampled several times a second - a
   real death is always read on the way down. 0.75 rather than something tighter because
   the existing pinned test kills a tower from 0.56 and a Rocket genuinely does that;
   0.75 blocks the full-health fabrication with margin and still lets damaged towers die.
   New test: `test_tower_hp_filter_will_not_kill_a_tower_it_never_saw_damaged`.

`pytest tests/test_brain.py -q`: **89 passed** (was 88 passed / 1 failed on arrival).
`tests/test_towers.py` 15 passed; `test_experience`, `test_push_and_economy`,
`test_defensive_micro`, `test_push_quality`, `test_elixir_trade`,
`test_reward_aggregation` 80 passed.

### Things I looked at and deliberately did not change

- **`cannon_min_threat` 5.0.** Cannon is the biggest single reward sink (-322 over 185
  recent plays, ~4.7 placements/match) and its top `vs=` targets are hog_rider 95,
  barbarian 83, **miner 79**, **goblin,goblin 70**. Raising it to 7.0 would cleanly split
  win-conditions and tanks (all threat >=7) from the chip units the deck answers more
  cheaply - but it breaks `test_cannon_pulls_knight_when_serious`, which pins a threat-5
  Knight, and the Miner case is genuinely ambiguous: web-verified, the Miner *does*
  prioritise buildings, so a Cannon is not strictly a non-answer. Left alone rather than
  rewriting a pinned test to fit. Someone should take this on with the test's intent in
  hand.
- **`cannon_repeat_seconds` is a dead key** - nothing in `scripts/` reads it. Do not
  bother tuning it. Cannon double-placement is real (traces show second Cannons 15-20s
  after the first, well inside the web-verified 30s lifetime) but the guard that exists is
  `if "cannon" not in obs.ally_names`, so the cause is the vision missing our own Cannon,
  not a missing cooldown. `VISION ours=1 theirs=3` lines are the tell.
- **`weights.defend_ranged` 54.0 -> 51.0.** The config's own comment pre-authorises this
  revert and the evidence half-supports it - Musketeer's single most common assignment is
  answering a Miner (71x), and the Miner is a dedicated counter to ranged troops, so that
  is 4 elixir fed into its best matchup. I skipped it only because change 1 already
  suppresses the same card and doing both in one shift would over-correct. **This is the
  first thing I would try next shift** if Musketeer is still negative.
- **The previous lead deleted the Hog elixir gate from `policy.py`** (the
  `hog_min_elixir_*` block in `_legal`), undocumented, leaving all four `hog_min_elixir_*`
  keys dead in `config.json`. I did not revert it: measured before/after, low-elixir Hogs
  went 26% -> 29% and threatened low-elixir Hogs 6% -> 9%, which is the wrong direction
  but only 58 samples. Flagging rather than acting on noise. Note the dead keys are a trap
  - the next agent may tune them and see nothing happen.

### For the next agent

1. **Check the three catastrophic-latch matches stop happening.** Grep `BARS_DEGRADED` in
   `cr_bot.log` and look for matches whose `hp_trace` shows enemy `0.00/0.00` in the first
   10 seconds. If the block report's crown counts move at all after this, that is the
   measurement getting honest, not the bot getting better or worse - do not read a swing
   in blocks 196-200 as a result of changes 1 and 2.
2. **The enemy colour mask is still the root cause** and is still unfixed. `tower_hp.py`
   handles deep-red and bright-pink fills; there is at least one more skin it misses, and
   `tmp/live/matches/bars_degraded_*.png` are saved frames of exactly that failure. That
   is a concrete, fixable perception bug with saved evidence sitting on disk - probably
   the highest-value thing left.
3. **Confirm `defend_fallback_*` volume actually fell** and that chip damage did not rise
   to replace it. If it did, lower `fallback_min_gap_seconds` back toward 12 before
   touching `emergency_min_threat` - that number is pinned to within 0.11 of the Mini
   P.E.K.K.A. line.
4. **`review.py` skipping blocks is still open** and now costs every agent real accuracy;
   `latest_block.md` was 2-3 blocks stale for my whole shift.
5. Someone should stop `sim/train_ppo.py` writing into `tmp/live/episodes.jsonl`, or give
   it its own file. See the trap section above.

### Addendum - block 196 landed during my shift

`review.py` caught up and wrote `latest_block.md` for block 196 while I was working, so
this is post-hoc but pre-change (my edits land from block 197 on). It confirms the read
above and sharpens two points:

- **0W 4L 1D, 4 for / 8 against** - a seventh consecutive negative block, and the worst
  differential of the seven.
- **Hog share 12.7%, the lowest recorded**, right on the 12% floor the brief calls "not
  playing the deck". Musketeer share also fell to 8.3% on its own, which is worth knowing
  before anyone also drops `defend_ranged` - the case for that revert is now weaker than
  it looked when I wrote it above.
- `defend_fallback_skeletons` 6 + `defend_fallback_ice_golem` 6 = 12 of 157 plays (7.6%),
  so change 2 has something real to bite on.
- Three of five matches again show `towers 0.00/0.00-...`, and m5 ended at 98s reading
  `0.00/0.00-0.00/1.00`. That is the latch pattern change 3 targets - m5 is a good first
  case to check against once block 197+ data exists.

## 2026-08-23 - captain shift (took over at block 206, changes land from 207)

Promoted after the previous lead went quiet for 131 minutes. Loop was healthy on arrival:
supervisor pid 25212, heartbeat 27s old, `cr_bot.py` mid-block, captain running. No
watchdog restart needed and nothing was stopped.

### What I observed

Read block 202 (`latest_block.md` was 4 blocks stale again - see item 4 below), block 206
which landed mid-shift, and aggregated the 20 match JSONs from 22:52 to 23:51.

**The bot is playing the deck but the Hog does nothing.** Hog share is 15.9-16.3% and
cards per match 29-33, both inside target - so the metrics the brief ranks 2nd and 3rd are
fine and are *not* where the loss is coming from. Crowns over those 20 matches: **5 for,
28 against.**

The cause is one specific thing, and both the config's own comments and `learned.json`
already predicted it:

- **The Ice Golem is being spent everywhere except on the Hog.** 86 plays across 20
  matches, of which only **13 (15%) tanked a Hog push**. 20 were `idle_cycle_ice_golem`
  and 11 `cycle_unblock_ice_golem` - 31 Golems dropped at (9,31) behind our own king
  tower.
- **So 77 of 90 Hogs went in naked.** The `_push` ladder is correct and already tries
  `golem_hog` first (`push_reserve_elixir` is 0), so this is purely a *hand availability*
  problem: the tank is not there when the Hog is.
- Block 206 m3 is the pattern in one trace: Golem idle-cycled at 16s and 43s, Hog naked at
  18s and 54s, and the only `push_golem_hog` of the match at 164s.
- `learned.json` agrees independently and is worth quoting, because it is the cleanest
  signal in the whole run: **`hog` is the only card family with a positive mean reward**
  (+0.098 over 4344 episodes). `defend` -1.23 (13805), `cycle` -1.15 (7014), `spell`
  -3.35 (1097), `chip` -3.73 (40). Within `cycle`, `ice_golem` is -1.93 over 1149 episodes
  against -0.15 for skeletons and -0.30 for ice_spirit.

### What I changed - 2 behaviour changes, plus repairing a red tree

**I inherited a failing test suite.** The previous lead's uncommitted config edits (adding
`the_log` to `cycle_unblock_exclude`, raising `cycle_any_elixir` 6.5 -> 9.5) plus their
edits to `tests/test_brain.py` left 2 tests failing at HEAD+worktree. I verified by
isolation that **none of my changes caused them.** Tree is now **89/89 green** and
`bounds.json` shows no violations.

1. **New `anti_idle_exclude` in `config.json`, containing `ice_golem`** (+ a 3-line change
   in `_anti_idle` to read it, defaulting to `cycle_unblock_exclude` so deleting the key
   restores old behaviour exactly). This is the main change and targets the finding above.
   It is a *separate* list on purpose: once `the_log` joined `cycle_unblock_exclude`, the
   Golem became the only card `_cycle_unblock` can still play, so it *is* the escape valve
   `_comment_cycle_cards` describes and must stay in that list. The idle filler has no
   such role. Kills `idle_cycle_ice_golem` (20/20 matches) while leaving the valve intact.

2. **`chip_spare_elixir` 9.5 -> 8.5.** This is a repair, not a tuning. Raising
   `cycle_any_elixir` to 9.5 opened a dead band at ~9 elixir in single elixir with an
   all-expensive hand: `_cycle_unblock` needed 9.5, `_chip` needed 9.5, and `_anti_idle`
   cannot cover the tick because it only fires after `max_idle_seconds`. That is exactly
   the failure `bounds.json` documents as 278 idle ticks and the user reporting the bot
   randomly stopping, and it is what `test_the_bot_is_never_idle_with_a_full_bar_and_no_threat`
   caught. 8.5 closes it with the play `spellinfo.py` endorses (Fireball at their tower
   with nothing on the field) instead of by dumping the Hog's tank.

3. **Repaired `test_a_cycled_spell_is_thrown_at_a_tower_not_our_own_back_line`.** The
   previous lead swapped `the_log` -> `ice_golem` in its hand, which destroyed the test's
   premise: with a cheap troop in hand `_cycle_unblock` legitimately returns the Golem, so
   no spell is ever cycled. Its sibling `test_an_expensive_hand_still_cycles_toward_the_hog`
   pins the *same hand* with the *opposite* assertion - both could not hold. Restored the
   all-expensive hand; the assertion now passes through `_chip`, which is where "at their
   tower, not our own back line" actually lives today.

**I deliberately did not make a third behaviour change.** Two of my candidates were wrong
on inspection and I am recording them so nobody re-tries them:

- *Emptying `idle_chip_spells`* (removing the Fireball chip filler): I tried it, and it
  broke 4 tests. Fireball chip is the designated outlet when the hand is all expensive
  cards; removing it reproduces the idle-band bug. The measured -3.73 chip family still
  looks bad, but the fix is not here.
- *Raising `fireball_finish_hp` off 0.052*: **already litigated and 0.052 is correct.**
  `spellinfo.py` documents it against this account's 3346-HP towers (Fireball 700 -> 175
  = 5.23%) and records that it was previously mis-set to 0.068 and 0.15. Web-verified
  2026-08-22 that the June 2026 balance update cut Fireball crown-tower damage 30% -> 25%,
  which is consistent. Leave it.

### For the next agent

1. **Measure change 1 first, in isolation.** `idle_cycle_ice_golem` should go to ~0 from
   block 207. The number that matters is not that tag but the ratio behind it: count
   `push_golem_hog_*` against total `hog_rider` plays. It was **13 of 90 (14%)**. If it
   does not move well above that, the Golem is being lost to *defence*
   (`defend_kite_*` 32, `defend_fallback_ice_golem` 10) rather than to the filler, and
   `kite_min_threat` (6.0, not bounded) is the next lever - not the Hog weights.
2. **Do not raise the `hog_*` weights to fix this.** Hog *share* is already in target at
   16%; the problem is Hog *effectiveness*. Raising the weights adds more naked Hogs and
   pushes share toward the 20% ceiling that means misread hands.
3. **The enemy tower-HP perception bug is still the biggest thing on the board**, and my
   data sharpens the previous entry. The early-latch is **fixed** - 0 of the last 20
   matches show enemy `0.00` inside 15s, so that change worked. But `BARS_DEGRADED` has
   fired **1078 times** and was still firing at 23:58 reading `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`, with
   34 saved frames in `tmp/live/matches/bars_degraded_*.png`. The tell in the match JSONs:
   over 646 readings our own towers take smooth intermediate values (0.31, 0.45, 0.68,
   0.73...) while enemy towers are **492x exactly 1.00** and then a tight cluster at
   0.11-0.16 with almost nothing in between. Enemy HP is not being read, it is defaulting.
   That matters beyond the scoreboard: "tower damage dealt" is a term in the
   `experience.py` reward, so every offensive play is being under-credited, which is a
   plausible reason the `defend` family has 13805 episodes and `hog` only 4344.
4. **`review.py` skipping blocks is still open.** `latest_block.md` was block 202 while the
   supervisor was on 206. Every agent is tuning on stale data.
5. **`hog_bridge_y` has never been tuned** - it has been 17 since "Baseline before brain
   rewrite" and is not in `bounds.json`. `arena.py` says y=16 is "at the bridge", so the
   Hog is being placed one row back on every single push. I did *not* change it: by
   `to_pixels`, y=16 lands at pixel y=834 which is close to the river line, and a rejected
   placement would mean no Hog at all. Worth someone verifying against a real frame that
   (3,16) is land - if it is, that is a free tempo gain on all ~90 Hogs per 20 matches.
6. The loop runs the **full** `tests/` directory, not just `test_brain.py`, and it is slow
   (>7 min). Budget for that if you run it.

### Addendum - I raced `review.py` and nearly corrupted its work

Recording this because it is an operational trap the brief does not warn about and I walked
straight into it.

At 00:01 the supervisor launched `scripts/review.py --block 206` (900s timeout). That
process runs its own agent, which **edits `config.json` and `tests/test_brain.py` live**.
I was still editing the same two files. For about seven minutes we overwrote each other:
my `git checkout HEAD -- scripts/brain/config.json` clobbered edits it had just made, and
its writes dropped `musketeer` out of the `anti_idle_exclude` list I had just added. Test
results were non-reproducible from one run to the next because the config changed
underneath the run.

What saved it is that the supervisor takes a `pre-review snapshot` commit before each
review, so all of my work was already in HEAD (`8b9fdc5`) and nothing was actually lost.

**What I should have done, and what the next agent should do:** before editing anything
under `scripts/brain/`, check for a running review:

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name like '%python%'" |
  Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -like '*review.py*' } | Select-Object ProcessId, CommandLine
```

If one is running, wait for it. A block is ~15 minutes; the review runs at the end of one.
Do not `git checkout` a file in `scripts/brain/` while it is alive.

**Final state of the tree at end of shift - verified after the review finished:**

- `tests/test_brain.py` **89/89 green**, `bounds.json` clean, no violations.
- All three of my changes survived the review: `anti_idle_exclude`
  (`[hog_rider, cannon, fireball, musketeer, the_log, ice_golem]`), the `_anti_idle` hook
  in `policy.py`, `chip_spare_elixir` 8.5, and the repaired cycled-spell test.
- The block-206 review agent independently re-applied `idle_chip_spells: []` - the exact
  change I had already tested and reverted for breaking four tests. It was most likely
  misled by a stale comment I had left in that key saying it had been emptied. I have
  replaced that comment with an explicit **DO NOT empty this key** note recording both
  attempts and the four tests it breaks. If a future agent is tempted by the -3.73 chip
  measurement, read that comment first.
- The review agent's one surviving test edit is a reasonable loosening
  (`later.tag.startswith("defend_fallback")` instead of pinning the exact card), which it
  needed because my `anti_idle_exclude` change alters which card the fallback picks.

One more thing for whoever is next: `review.py --block 206` (pid 24084) was **still alive
past its own 900s timeout** when the supervisor had already moved on to block 208. Worth
checking whether review processes are being reaped, or whether they accumulate.

---

## 2026-08-23 - blocks 214-216 (lead: claude, took over from a 145-min-quiet lead)

### Loop health

Alive on arrival. Supervisor pid 17480 (block 216, `status: playing`), heartbeat 11 min old.
Watchdog and captain tasks both firing. Disk 32 GB free - above the ~10 GB floor, but note it
fell 52.9 -> 33.6 GB in one block. That was a single step drop, not a trend, and it lines up
with the `sim.train_ppo --name kl02` run (pid 53964) writing checkpoints. Stable since. Worth a
glance next shift; if it steps again, prune the sim checkpoints, not `tmp/live/matches/`.

**I reaped two orphaned review processes.** `review.py --block 209` (pids 14420, 6380) had been
alive **2h05m against its own 900s timeout**, while the supervisor had moved eight blocks past
it. This is exactly the accumulation the previous agent flagged at the end of the last entry, so
it is now confirmed as real and recurring, not a one-off. The supervisor only kills the review it
is *currently tracking* as "previous" (it killed pid 6228 at 3288s during block 214), so a review
that gets skipped over is never reaped and lives forever. Two of these were holding CPU against
the sim training run and - worse - a stale agent CLI can still write to `scripts/brain/` hours
later, which is the hazard the last entry warned about. I killed only the 209 pair; the 214 pair
(pids 35020, 7796) is still tracked by the supervisor, so I left it alone.

**For the next agent: this is the loop bug worth fixing.** It is in `supervisor.py`, which the
brief says to leave alone *unless you are fixing the loop itself* - this qualifies. The fix is to
reap any `review.py` older than its timeout on every pass, not just the one held in `prev_pid`.

### How the bot is playing

Block 214 was the last completed report: **0W 5L, 3 crowns for / 9 against.** The secondary
metrics are all *fine*, which is the interesting part - Hog share 16.0% (target 15-25%), 32.6
cards per match, `defend_fallback_*` down to 6 of 163 plays. The bot is cycling the deck
correctly and still losing every match. So the problem is not volume, it is that the elixir is
going to the wrong plays.

The block-216 m1 trace makes it concrete. Our left tower bled 1.00 -> 0.20 across the match while
**their towers sat at 1.00/1.00 until 168s of a 182s match.** Six Hog Riders, all correctly placed
at the bridge (`(3,16)`/`(14,16)`, which matches `arena.BRIDGE_X` and the 2.6 guides), and only
the last one connected. Meanwhile the bot answered every small thing that crossed the river.

`learned.json` says the same thing far more loudly. Bucketed by `experience.threat_bucket`, the
**`defend|small` band (0 < threat < 8) is negative for every single card at volume**:

| situation | card | n | mean |
|---|---|---|---|
| defend\|small | musketeer | 532 | **-6.36** |
| defend\|small | ice_golem | 667 | -3.34 |
| defend\|small | cannon | 964 | -3.12 |
| defend\|small | skeletons | 513 | -1.58 |
| defend\|small | ice_spirit | 424 | -1.15 |

~3100 plays, not one of them positive. The same cards in `defend|medium|contained` run **+1.64,
+1.56, +0.21**. The bot is not bad at defending - it is bad at deciding *whether* to defend.

### What I changed (3, all in `config.json`)

1. **`defend_min_threat` 6.0 -> 8.0.** 8.0 is exactly the small/medium boundary in
   `experience.threat_bucket`, so the gate and the measurement now agree and next block's data is
   directly interpretable: **the `defend|small` bucket should nearly empty out.** That is the
   check to run. The emergency branch (`emergency_min_threat` 4.5, `emergency_depth` 19) is
   untouched and remains the backstop, so a 4-8 threat is not ignored - it is answered late, at
   the tower, and cheaply.
2. **`fireball_min_value_cost` 4 -> 5.** Gates *only* the lone-support-unit branch; the cluster
   branch (`spell_min_value_elixir`) and every defensive Fireball are untouched. At 4, a lone
   4-cost unit - overwhelmingly a Musketeer - drew an even-trade Fireball that also gave away the
   deck's answer to a support cluster. `value_fireball_musketeer` fired twice inside one 182s
   match. Fireball measures negative in every bucket it has volume in (`spell|none|contained`
   -3.34 over 878).
3. **`weights.defend_ranged` 54.0 -> 51.0.** This is the value the existing comment on that key
   already prescribes for exactly this evidence. The raise to 54 successfully fixed Musketeer's
   play share (7.4% -> 9.8%), but bought it by winning ground-support bids from the Cannon, and
   the Cannon measures better in the same spots (`defend|medium|contained` cannon +0.21 vs
   musketeer -1.99). Her air role (`defend_air` 62.0) and anti-outranger role
   (`defend_outranged` 75.0) are separate keys and untouched.

(1) cuts defensive *volume*; (3) only reallocates *within* the remaining defensive bids, toward
the card that measures better. They compose rather than stacking.

`tests/test_brain.py` **89/89 green.** I also corrected two test docstrings that still asserted
`defend_min_threat` was 6.0.

### A dead end, recorded so nobody repeats it

I went after `fireball_finish_hp` (0.052) because web search confirms the **June 1 2026 balance
update cut Fireball's Crown Tower damage 30% -> 25%**, and I assumed 0.052 predated it. **It does
not - do not "fix" this.** `spellinfo.py`'s module docstring derives the number from extracted
client data at `CrownTowerDamagePercent: -75`, i.e. the 25% figure, and the arithmetic checks out
(700 damage -> 175 -> 175/3346 HP = 5.23%). The Log entry is consistent too (275 -> 35 -> 1.05%).
The spell constants are current as of Aug 2026.

### What the next agent should look at

1. **Did `defend|small` empty out?** Re-run the `learned.json` bucket table above. If that band is
   still filling up, `defend_min_threat` is not the gate that admits those plays and the real
   entry point is the emergency branch or `_cannon_pull` (`cannon_min_threat`, still 6.0).
2. **Did our towers start bleeding chip instead?** This is the predicted failure mode of change
   (1) and the brief warns about the direction. Compare `hp_trace` decay on our towers against
   block 216. If the bot is now visibly walking past pushes that hurt it, lower
   `defend_min_threat` *before* touching `emergency_min_threat` - that one is pinned to within
   0.11 of the Mini P.E.K.K.A. line.
3. **Fireball share.** If it falls below ~3%, do *not* just revert (2) to 4. The lone-unit branch
   admits a cost-4 single either when `approaching` (no tower chip - the genuinely bad version) or
   when `on_tower` (4 elixir *plus* 5.2% of a tower - fine). The better fix is a small
   `policy.py` change allowing cost-4 singles only when `on_tower`.
4. **Perception.** I did not touch this and it may be the real ceiling: 191 card-slot flips over 5
   matches (38/match), and `classifier_overrides` of 142 and 112 in two block-216 matches. If the
   hand is being misread that often, every tuning change above is being applied to a policy that
   is sometimes choosing from a hand it does not actually have.

## 2026-08-23 - blocks 223-226 - the enemy tower HP reader was measuring the empty bar

Took over as lead; previous lead had been quiet 142 minutes. Loop was alive (supervisor pid
17480, block 226 playing, heartbeat 11 min old) so I did not restart anything.

### What I observed

Nine blocks, 45 matches, **zero wins**: 199 through 223 run 0W-38L-7D, ~2 crowns for and ~7
against per block. Meanwhile metrics 2, 3 and 4 are all *in spec* - Hog share 13-18%, 22-38 cards
per match, `defend_fallback_*` down at 5 tags in block 223. The tuning knobs were not the lever,
so I went at the measurement instead.

**Enemy tower HP was never being read.** Every `hp_trace` on disk shows the enemy pair pinned at
`1.00/1.00` for the whole match, dropping only to `0.00` when a tower actually fell. Block 223
m1 threw two Fireballs directly onto enemy towers and the enemy bars did not move - that is not
possible, so it was the reader.

`scripts/tower_hp.py` had a fourth colour term in the enemy mask, `dark_red`, admitting
`(r>85) & (g<60) & (b<90) & (r-g>25)`. Sampled at y=293 in `bars_degraded_042718.png`: the bar's
**fill** is a flat `(255, 205, 255)` and the **drained track behind it** is a flat `(93, 50, 73)`
- which passes `dark_red` exactly. The run-length walk started at the anchor, crossed the fill,
bridged the 2px divider on the existing gap tolerance, and ran on through the empty track to the
end. Every living enemy tower measured the full 119px.

Measured over the 31 in-battle frames on disk, the old mask returned exactly 1.0 thirty times and
exactly 0.0 thirty times - **two intermediate values in 62 readings**. It was a two-state device.

Ground truth on that frame: the tower prints **1331 hitpoints** and the corrected mask measures
**0.370**, implying a full bar of 3597 against a level-12 princess tower's 3600. (Web search could
not produce the per-level table - fandom 402s, clasher.us and noff.gg 403 - but the printed
number is better evidence than a wiki anyway.) The ally reader has no equivalent problem: its
empty track is the same maroon and fails the blue test by a wide margin.

**This poisoned the learner, not just the report.** `experience.py`'s reward is
`enemy elixir killed + tower damage dealt - elixir spent - tower damage taken`. The third term was
pinned at zero while the fourth was read correctly, so every attacking play scored as pure cost.
It is written all over `learned.json`: `hog|none|contained` had **hog_rider -0.90 over 3372
samples** while ice_spirit in the same bucket sat at +5.34. Through `bias()` that is a **~7 point
swing against the deck's only win condition** in the one bucket that decides whether to Hog.
`finish|none|contained` fireball was -6.69 - the finisher was the most negative entry in the
table. Every high-volume positive entry was defensive. The learner had been told, over thousands
of samples, that attacking does not work.

### What I changed (3)

1. **`scripts/tower_hp.py`** - dropped `dark_red` from the enemy mask. On the same 31 frames the
   reader now spreads across all ten deciles instead of returning only 1.0 and 0.0.
2. **`scripts/brain/learned.json`** - dropped the 24 buckets prefixed `hog|`, `spell|`, `chip|`,
   `finish|` (6223 samples). These are exactly the buckets whose reward depended on the missing
   term. `bias()` damps by `count/(count+K)`, so at n=3372 that -0.90 was fully applied and
   correctly-measured episodes would have needed thousands of samples to overcome it. `defend|*`
   and `cycle|*` are **kept** - those plays rarely deal tower damage, so their reward was
   measured correctly. Backup at `learned.json.pre_hpfix`. Applied in the gap between blocks 226
   and 227, after the running bot had exited, so it would not be clobbered by its save.
3. **Reverted the uncommitted `config.json` / `policy.py` edits** left in the tree by the
   block-223 review, which timed out mid-flight (`gemini_pro` at 900s, then `kimi` hung 3071s
   until the supervisor killed it). They set `cannon_min_threat` 8.0 -> 5.0 and swapped
   `ice_golem` -> `musketeer` in `cycle_exclude` / `anti_idle_exclude`, and they **broke three
   tests**. The `policy.py` half also hardcoded `1` in place of `self.cfg("log_min_units", 3)`,
   which the brief explicitly discourages. Unreviewed, untested, from a review that never
   finished. The musketeer-exclusion *idea* is reasonable - block 223 spent 14 plays cycling a
   4-cost Musketeer to nowhere - and is worth redoing properly, via config, with the tests run.

### Verification

Block 227 started 05:25 with both fixes live. Enemy HP now walks down continuously instead of
snapping - m4 reads
`1.00 -> 0.94 -> 0.67 -> 0.34 -> 0.12 -> 0.00` on one tower and `1.00 -> 0.87 -> 0.52 -> 0.18` on
the other, finishing `0.83/0.00-0.00/0.18`: a crown for us and the second tower nearly down. Under
the old reader that entire match would have logged as `-1.00/1.00` and credited the learner
nothing.

### Test state - read this before you change anything

`tests/test_brain.py` is **88 passed, 2 failed**, and **both failures predate this shift** - they
are present at HEAD (`d9945c8`), which I verified by checking out HEAD's `config.json` and
`policy.py` and re-running. None of my three changes adds a failure. I deliberately did **not**
fix them, because both are behavioural and would confound the read on change (1); the next
reviewer needs a clean signal. They are:

- `test_cycle_to_hog_elixir_beats_idle_floor` - a pure config invariant:
  `max_idle_seconds` (10.0) must exceed `cycle_to_hog_elixir * 2.8` (12.6). One-line fix, but note
  the test assumes starting from zero elixir, which never really happens; consider whether the
  invariant or the config is wrong.
- `test_lone_small_threat_defended_cheaply_not_with_expensive_cards` - the bot counter-pushes with
  the Hog against a lone Knight at 9 elixir instead of answering with Skeletons. This one is a
  real policy disagreement, not a typo.

### What the next agent should look at

1. **Read the crowns, and give it more than one block.** Everything above is a *measurement* fix;
   the payoff is that the learner can now see tower damage at all. `hog|*` and `spell|*` will
   refill from zero. Do **not** re-tune the Hog off two blocks of thin data - `bias()` needs
   volume before it means anything.
2. **`matchups.json` is still poisoned.** Its `reward` field comes from the same broken term, and
   `lessons.py` turns it into the advisor's prompt. I left it alone to stay inside three changes.
   Pruning the `hog_rider` / `fireball` / `the_log` rows is the obvious follow-up.
3. **The review dispatcher is a single-slot queue and it jams.** Blocks 224 and 225 were skipped
   outright with `REVIEW previous still running`, so three blocks played with no review at all.
   The supervisor does self-heal (it killed the stuck pid after 3071s) but only at a block
   boundary. If this keeps happening, the fix is in `supervisor.py` - which the brief protects,
   so it is a deliberate loop fix, not a tuning change.
4. **Perception is still the standing suspect.** `classifier_overrides` hit 131 and 154 in the
   last two matches, and hand-flips run 39-51 per match. Unchanged from the previous lead's note.
