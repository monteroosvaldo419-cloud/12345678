## Interpretation boundary

The repository URLs identify public origins. Claims about tick rates, performance, completeness, or fidelity remain **project claims** unless this report explicitly says they were verified from code. The CDN snapshot is a third-party publication and must not automatically overwrite HastyCR data or become a calibration oracle.
