# Reference licenses and pinned revisions

Observed 2026-08-23. “Reusable” is a conservative sprint classification, not legal advice; reuse still requires attribution/notice and dependency review. Local links identify the inspected evidence.

## Clean-room conclusion

Nothing from these repositories was copied into simulator implementation. Permissive licensing makes some projects candidates for later, separately reviewed reuse, but this sprint uses all of them as evidence and design comparison only. Missing or restrictive licensing overrides technical attractiveness.

## Differential framework usage

Task #7 uses the CRForge and clash-royale-suite repositories as source/API and license evidence only. No code, data, bridge, extension, or runtime payload was copied or executed. The local adapters are clean-room descriptors that preserve the pinned provenance and return `UNAVAILABLE` until a separately authorized, dependency-complete execution environment is reviewed.
