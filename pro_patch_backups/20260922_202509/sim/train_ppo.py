"""Train a policy in the headless environment with PPO.

Two purposes, and the second is the one that matters soonest.

1. A learned policy, eventually better than the hand-written one.
2. **A sparring partner.** The simulator's problem is that it has no opponent
   resembling the ladder: the mirror defends exactly as well as we attack, and
   `SimpleOpponent` loses 99.7% of the time. Every sweep run here has therefore
   answered "does this beat a copy of me", which is not the question. An agent
   trained to beat the hand-written brain is the first opponent in this project
   that is neither trivial nor identical to us.

Design choices worth knowing:

**Masked logits, not penalties.** ~2,300 actions with a few dozen legal at any
moment cannot be learned by rejection. Illegal logits are set to -inf before the
softmax, so the policy only ever assigns probability to legal moves and the
entropy term measures something real.

**A small network on purpose.** The observation is 8x32x18 planes plus 47
scalars - closer to a board game than to pixels - and this shares a GPU with the
detector the live bot is using. Three conv layers is enough, and keeps a rollout
step cheaper than the environment step that produced it.

**Evaluation is greedy and against the brain.** Training reward is shaped by
tower damage, so it does not directly answer "does this win". Every eval runs
argmax actions against the hand-written policy and reports the record.
