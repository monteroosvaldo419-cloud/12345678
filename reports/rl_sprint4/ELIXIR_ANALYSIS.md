# Elixir Analysis — Sprint 4

**Key Finding:**
- Time at 10 elixir: 0.1% of decision ticks (76/135163). Leak indicates missed deployment windows.
- Avg elixir at play: 2.52. High value suggests holding too long; low suggests elixir dumping.
- Plays total: 17241 across 300 games (57.5 per game).

**Limitation:** No greedy re-evaluation; elixir leak estimated from tick snapshots only. No opponent elixir comparison (not in observation).
