# Match Phase Analysis — Sprint 4

**Key Finding:**
- Most tower damage occurs in mid/late game; early phases are low-event. OT behavior (if present) shows whether the policy can close.
- Phase segmentation reveals where the tower→crown conversion fails.

**Limitation:** Phases are wall-clock buckets, not game-state-aware (e.g., first crown taken). No win-conditioned split yet.
