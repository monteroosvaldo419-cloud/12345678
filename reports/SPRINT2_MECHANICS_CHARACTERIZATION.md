## Interpretation

- Targeting uses current visible-candidate edge-gap selection and reports acquisition reasons through diagnostics.
- Ground cross-river movement uses the current cached bridge-aware flow field; dynamic buildings use local steering and collision push-out.
- Collision probes confirm current non-overlap behavior and expose the current mass-weighted solver output, not live collision semantics.
- Same-tick diagnostics expose the current phase order and death-before-cleanup behavior.
- Projectile timestamps are current fixed-tick scheduling behavior and require live target-motion observations before calibration.

## Boundary

The probes do not change `real_measurements=0`, do not produce an accuracy scalar, and do not move HastyCR to RL-ready status.
